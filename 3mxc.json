				"This “white” meat is actually pinkish-brown even when cooked due to the high iron content born from its home plane of Acheron. It's rather tough meat, and smells faintly of its smoky breath. It's difficult to obtain achaierai meat as in some places the fiends bodies vanish on death to their respective lower planes, but in places where the corpse survives the meat can be harvested. The meat is tough enough to dull typical iron knives, and so many pre-cook the meat in a slow cooker to tenderize it, then grill it afterword. This is also done because the temperatures needed to properly cook the meat is higher than most, near the melting point of iron, and as such it is often cooked in blacksmith's furnaces. However once properly prepared it is a delicious and rich smoky flavor which “tastes like chicken”. Care is needed in cooking. If undercooked the eater suffers as if they had been exposed to the achaierai black cloud ability. However when properly cooked the eater gains the ability to use the achaierai's black cloud ability once. Multiple meals do not stack, so a creature can only have one black cloud at a time. The type cloud depends upon the preparation - DC 14 (Fog Cloud); DC 18 (Stinking Cloud); DC 22 - Cloudkill. It lasts until discharged without concentration. The eater is immune to their own black cloud, as are other achaierais. Saves for the Cloud are based off the ingester's Spell/Ability DC (8+Proficency Bonus + ability modifier (if the creature's class has no such ability, use Constitution ability modifier) This effect cannot be stacked. You may only have the effects of 2 food items at once."

				"Grown on the Opuntia Cactus, the Karura's Cactus Fruit is a great source of nourishment and moisture. Each one provides a full days’ worth of nourishment, water and cures up to 1 level of exhaustion due to dehydration. Eating it also grants the eater the effects of the Endure Elements spell. It is only found in temples of Karura that have springs of pure water in them. Growing them takes a skill check Herbalism DC 14. Each Opuntia produces 2 Karura's Cactus Fruit in just 1 day, but does not grow new one until they have been picked. Once picked, they only last for 1 week until they spoil and lose all their effects. They are normally maintained and harvested by temple clerics to be sold. A follower of Karura is normally given a 25% discount after they have paid homage. If they are attempted to be grown outside the temple, they do not produce any fruit."
