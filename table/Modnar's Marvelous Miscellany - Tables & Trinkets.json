					"A series of regal-looking interconnected hallways are dimly lit with magical torches suspended in sconces. The entrance that the intruders come through suddenly closes itself off, and the intruders sit in silence for a few seconds. Looking down one of the other hallways reveals a slowly encroaching patch of darkness that snuffs out the torches as it makes its way forward, which relight themselves when intruders approach them while the darkness is not nearby. The intruders must search the various corridors while simultaneously avoiding the patch of darkness, which envelops and leaves no trace of anything that enters it. Any attempts to do combat with the darkness prove ineffectual, as anything that enters vanishes, never to be seen again. The darkness is semi-sentient, and the intruders can interact with it by trying to hide from it or get it to follow them. The key to escaping the hallways lies with the magic torches in the two impressively decorated sconces that the darkness can’t seem to pass by. By removing one of the special torches and carrying it with them, an intruder can hold off the darkness or even push it back. However, confronting it for too long will begin to dim the torch until it eventually snuffs out, forcing the holder to escape the darkness in order for the torch to relight. When the special torches approach the darkness from both sides of a hallway, it condenses and eventually fades, leaving a shadowy door to the outside where the last of it vanished."

					"A roughly cut gemstone hovers ominously over a crude alter in a cavernlike room while a malicious spirit floats up around the ceiling and out of sight. New entities entering the room causes the crystal turn to face the intruders, revealing that it is actually an eye of some sort, containing a pupil that darts rapidly between the intruders and the spirit. The spirit immediately begins cajoling the crystal eye into destroying the intruders, talking to it as though it were a child in need of guidance. After a few seconds of apparent listening, the eye completely focuses on the spirit and pillars of rock begin to rapidly erupt from the room’s surfaces at points near the intruders. The pillars, while initially inaccurate, begin homing in on the intruders more and more the longer they stay still, and do 5d10 bludgeoning damage on a hit. The key to escaping the room is the crystal eye in the center of the room, which is being told by the spirit to kill the intruders. By being more persuasive than the spirit, intruders can convince the eye to stop its onslaught and eventually target the spirit instead, which will disperse after being hit multiple times with pillars of rock. The eye is very childlike in its considerations and will lose focus if the intruders fail to convince it or begin to act too impatient. Simplistic approaches work well, and the eye responds positively to constructive encouragement when it targets the intruders (That was some very good aiming, I could feel the wind rush by me! Next time though, try to aim towards the mean spirit instead, OK?). Once the spirit is destroyed, a gentle suggestion that the eye create an exit will convince it to pull a slab of rock away from a wall and reveal a passage to outside the room."

Once the next hallway both statues have hands that turn, and one activates the traps just cleared while the other deactivates the ones ahead (but both can’t happen so if the try to deactivate the traps ahead it will still be active). And finally the last hallway will deactivate the traps but the floor is pressure sensitive. Illustrate this by having the party see the hand start to turn back when a member starts to walk across.

A kobold who was waiting kicks a weight attached to a chain out and it drags the member down the side of the cliff to about 20ft above the next level (assuming they don’t pass a strength check at disadvantage). The ambush comes and there are kobolds on the lower level trying to reach the member while the party is ambushed and distracted. They will have to decide who is saving their friend and who is fighting, while the member is dangling and until he gets himself right side up is at a disadvantage to all attacks.

This obviously leads to a pit, but in the pit is nothing. It simply drops you 50ft leaving you in like a 20ft square room that’s 50ft high."

When the top 3 stairs detect any pressure, the top door has panels that open and let in the lava. The bottom door is locked, and panels in the floor at the bottom of the stairs open only after the entire hallway has filled with lava and the top door panels close again."

					"A well with a rope or chain that hangs to the bottom. There is a grate about 100′ down that goes nowhere. The walls of the well have small holes all along its length, possibly from climbing pitons. Once a certain amount of weight is applied to the rope (equivalent to two or three party members) a gelatinous cube is poured from its cell behind the stones in the wall, and seeps through the walls into the well above the players. The gelatinous cube paralyzes creatures when they touch it and fail a save. The cube happily slides down the well and consumes its prey until all organic material is digested, then it seeps through the grate at the bottom and it collected and replaced in its cell behind the stonework."

					"A treasure chest in a 10′ square pit. The entire pit is clean and smooth stone, making it difficult to climb. If weight is added to the floor of the pit (set to the weight of one or more humanoid adventurers) the pit and 1 foot of the pit walls is shot upward to the ceiling cutting off all means of escape. The walls then close in and collapse all humanoids unless they pile on top of the chest, which is not crushed. The treasure chest is a mimic but is magically paralyzed until the walls fully collapse inward, at which point he mimic is released from its spell and the trap resets in 1d4 days."

The bridge itself is relatively safe, but there is a thin tripwire halfway through it, that activates the hole, making it spill out a line of fire over the end of the bridge."

					"This is a standard pit-trap with a twist. At the bottom of the pit, and for ten feet up the walls, everything is coated in pitch. Pitch may be sticky, but in quantity it also acts like any other oil-based liquid – a lubricant. Climbing up a rope becomes extremely unlikely for whoever fell down the hole. But that’s not the worst bit. A couple of rounds after the pit trap is activated, the Kobolds, warned by a bell attached to the pit trap’s trigger, will show up with lit torches. And one of them will start combat by throwing a torch into the pit – igniting the pitch!"

The heroes have to pile into the boat and row across the lake to the next section of the dungeon. Well, this particular lake is guarded by kobolds with spyglasses. And a few barrels full of lamp oil. And a torch. Be sure to wait until the party is most of the way across the lake before the kobolds start pouring lamp oil on the water."

While most Kobolds choose to make tight passages that only a Tiny creature can squeeze into (thanks to their ability to fit into unlikely places), some rely on the fact that their pursuers are generally heavier, and in larger numbers, than themselves. Choose a corridor, and undermine it (dig a tunnel under the floor, but with too little material acting as floor/ceiling). Leave it just enough strength to handle the weight of a Kobold or two. Fill the corridor below with something nasty, and have it lead somewhere nasty. As a finishing touch, make sure there’s a collapsing ceiling in the upper tunnel as well to ensure that the heroes can’t climb back out after you."

					"Gold melts at a surprisingly low temperature: Did you know that you can melt gold in a candle flame? It would probably take about an hour to do so from room temperature, but you can. More importantly, if you keep your gold coins at a hot enough temperature, they’ll melt very quickly if exposed to a very potent heat source – like say they might melt within seconds if they were doused in lamp oil and lit. This is an interesting thing to note if your chosen method of storing gold coins is in a wire-mesh cage attached to the ceiling. Especially if such a cage is kept at very high temperature, and is trapped with various kinds of flame traps (flame traps that trigger onto the gold). Unfortunately, while the temperature might be relatively high compared to the meltin point of most metal, it’s still more than enough to cook any flesh it comes in contact with (and STICK to that flesh, as molten metal tends to, causing the WORST sort of burns). And of course, the easiest way to get at the gold itself is from directly below it. Be sure to note to the party how hot it is in the room with the gold while they’re standing under it. If they’re clever enough to figure out the trap beforehand, hopefully they’re also clever enough to notice the hidden drains in the floor before all that molten gold runs (very, very quickly) down those drains."

It’s important that the PC’s don’t get a chance to detect this trap or they’ll quickly find a solution (Search DC30). The character is teleported to a sealed tomb filled with the skeletons of various victims. A black pudding, CR equal to the party, attempts to engulf the teleported PC and turn him into a skeleton with its acid. When the trap goes off, one of these skeletons is instantly teleported to where the PC was standing, making it appear like he was disintegrated. Make a Search DC 25 to notice the skeleton (pile of bones) is not the same makeup as the PC (DC 20 if the size category of the PC is one larger or smaller than medium). After six teleportations, the “living” victims (or their remains) are teleported back to the trap area. Defeat the trap by moving statues into the area so they can be teleported, eventually sending out “victims.”"
