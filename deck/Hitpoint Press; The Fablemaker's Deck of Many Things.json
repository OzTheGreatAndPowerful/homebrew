				"The 5e {@item deck of many things} is a fantastic item with powerful magic. It can change your game in an instant, for better or worse. Each card drawn from the deck immediately impacts the character who draws from it, and in some cases, it can reshape reality itself.",
				"You can use either the Overworld or Underworld half of the deck to represent this item in your games as a fun interactive tool for players. They can draw from the deck when they declare that their character will, or the Game Master (GM) can draw for them if you are playing online. The Overworld effects of the cards detailed in this booklet are the standard effects of the deck of many things.",
				"However, the Fablemaker's deck of many things offers another way to play, bringing more risk and potentially more rewards than ever. The Underworld effects are an alternate version of the deck of many things. There are several ways to include these new effects in your game. You can choose to use only the Underworld effects of the cards, or you can flip a coin to determine whether the effect of a drawn card is the standard Overworld effect or the new Underworld effect. You can also shuffle both halves together and let the luck of the draw determine the effect by applying the effect matching the card drawn. For even more customization, you can select the cards you want from the Overworld and Underworld and combine them into your own unique deck of many things."
