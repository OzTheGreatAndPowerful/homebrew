##### Getting help

- Join the [5etools Discord Server](https://discord.gg/v3AXzcW) and ask in the #homebrew channel.

##### Creating and Contributing

- The easiest way to make your own is to copy one of the existing 'brews as a template and use the main [5etools data](https://github.com/TheGiddyLimit/TheGiddyLimit.github.io/tree/master/data) as a reference.
- The schemata for the main site data can be found [here](https://github.com/TheGiddyLimit/TheGiddyLimit.github.io/tree/master/test/schema)
- Contributions are welcome. For the Git-literate, make a pull request. For everyone else, create an Issue and post a link to your file (PasteBin is fine), and I (or other maintainers, in future) can add it for you.

A schema is available (`json.schema`) describing the layout of the and usage of the `_meta` property found in the various data files.

###### Conventions to Follow

There are a few conventions used which should be followed when creating homebrew:
 - Filename format is "Author Name; Homebrew Name.json"
 - Sources with no URL should use `https://github.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew` as the URL
 - Source `"author"` should only include content authors; conversion credit should be included in a `"convertedBy"` property (with the same format).
