It's a level of detail that you don't find in many adventure stories. The food that one encounters traveling across Exandria doesn't just help immerse the audience into the story, it makes us downright HUNGRY. And this wonderfully crafted cookbook is a remarkable chance to share the wonders of Matt's imaginary cuisine and make it a tastable, cookable reality. The chefs, cooks, tasters, editors, writers, artists, and photographers who contributed to this book poured themselves into developing recipes that aren't merely homages to their favorite fantasy campaign\u2014they're actually really great dishes. And armed with the recipes in these pages, you'll be able to entertain guests with novel, and sometimes very strange, dinners, while sharing the stories of Critical Role to a new, hungry audience."

								"It began, as the best things do, with a group of friends sitting around a table.",
								"We were reading {@i The Daring Trials and Tribulations of Sir Taryon Darrington} in our book club. (If you haven't read it yourself, give it a try: it is a wild ride.) Since most of us are good with food, and a book club is hardly worth the name without snacks, we try to bring treats themed to the book we're reading. Sir Darrington does provide quite a bit of detail about everything in his adventures, including what he eats. Some of his accounts were confounding, though. For instance, a drink called {@recipe Changebringer's Nectar|ExEX} that he describes as \"maple syrup grain alcohol\" sounds terrible, but he declares it to be tasty. We were intrigued.",
								"As we mentioned, most of us are skilled at experimenting with food and having it come out well. (One of us, it must be said, is hopeless in the kitchen. She's great at complimenting the chefs, though, and she spins a good yarn.) But we found that Sir Darrington's descriptions, while evocative, weren't enough to actually cook from. We needed more information. How does one actually {@i make} this stuff?",
								"Happily, one of us was traveling through Deastok soon after that, and she managed to talk the bartender at the Grumpy Lily tavern into giving up {@i two} of his recipes. He may have been willing to share his secrets because both drinks are nearly impossible to make at home, but we were undeterred. We tried. We failed. We tried again. Finally, we reproduced versions of both drinks that we were satisfied with, and we celebrated by drinking far too much of them.",
								"We had triumphed, and we wanted to do it again. Now it was bothering us: there were so many special meals, so many delicious drinks, throughout Exandria that we had never tried, never mind tried to make. We wanted more exploration, more experimentation, more recipes. We aren't cut out to be brigadiers like Taryon and his crew, but we could have adventures in our own way. We could find our own type of treasure. It turned into a hobby: go on vacation, bring back a recipe. Then it turned into a mission: who can get to Vasselheim in time for Highsummer?",
								"In our search for food, we found far more stories than we were expecting. It turns out the two are tied together more often than not, and the food is so much better when you know how it came to be. So we collected recipes, and we collected tales, and we brought them back to share with one another around the table. Before we knew it, our book club had created a book. There is so much more to explore and eat and make in this world, but it became time for us to stop sharing with one another and start sharing with you.",
								"Here, at last, is the product of our adventures, a list of our labors, little slices of this exquisite place we live in that you can re-create at home. We hope you enjoy these banquets, bites, and beverages from across Exandria\u2014and the stories behind them."

						"You may think you know what Tal'Dorei cuisine is like. {@i Oh}, you say,{@i  I've eaten at A Taste of Tal'Dorei. I've had Thordak's Pepper Poppers; it's basically like I've been to Emon. Why, the Rimelord told me I might survive his frozen death!}",
						"Or perhaps, reading this, you're forming a different impression. {@i Ah}, you're thinking. {@i They're about to dunk hard on A Taste of Tal'Dorei. Here it comes! Make sure to mention the bored theater majors pretending they're evil warlords and stuff!}",
						"So let's get this out of the way, right at the beginning: if there is a place in Exandria today that has earned its cheesy enjoyments, it's Tal'Dorei. If there is a place worthy of celebrating with overblown drama and collectible pencils, it's Tal'Dorei. Come with us on a short tour of the past, so we can remind you of the forces shaping Tal'Dorei's culture, cuisine, and dinner theater entertainment alike. Because, while all of Exandria has been through turmoil, Tal'Dorei is the place that has been most recently and thoroughly turned upside down.",
						"No corner of Exandria, of course, escaped the ravages of the Calamity. Afterward, the land that would become Tal'Dorei went through a time of rebuilding. The dwarves beneath the northern mountains burrowed deep to form the subterranean city of Kraghammer. A group of elves who had magically transported themselves to the Fey Realm to escape the terrors of the Calamity returned to the Verdant Expanse in the south, founding the city of Syngorn. Then humans crossed the Ozmit Sea and spread up the western side of Tal'Dorei, establishing settlements and fighting for power.",
						"Eventually the humans' shortsightedness and violence erupted into war. Three decades of bloodshed and tumult later, a young warrior named Zan Tal'Dorei reunified people under her leadership. A council was nominated to rule alongside her in the capital city of Emon. The realm was renamed in her honor. Everyone was ready to lay down their arms and rest.",
						"But, just two years later, Errevon the Rimelord attacked the still-reeling continent. The Tal'Dorei Council, Syngorn, and Kraghammer united against the ice elemental spirit, pushed him back into the rift, and with the help of the Ashari druids, sealed it.",
						"The land had been permanently altered. Two formerly fertile regions were cursed and scarred by the wars, known ever after as the blighted Umbra Hills and the icy Frostweald. Finally, though, a period of peace came. Tal'Dorei became an empire. Generations passed. The upheavals in the land were minor and absorbed with relative aplomb. When a wizard living in the Bramblewood botched a spell and flooded the eastern forest with a thousand surprised chickens, the enterprising folks of nearby Westruun just shrugged and set up a new export market. The Great Feathering of 641 PD is still spoken of in mostly fond terms, a minor blip in a calm century. Still, in hindsight, it doesn't seem like enough rest.",
						"About fifty years ago, the avaricious red dragon known as Thordak, the Cinder King, laid waste to the Mornset Countryside in the south. His banishment to the Elemental Plane of Fire lasted more than a decade, but while there, he grew stronger and formed an alliance with four other chromatic dragons. At the end of 810 PD, Thordak broke free of his planar prison, and the Chroma Conclave ravaged Emon. Thordak settled amid the ruins of the capital, while his three compatriots spread out across the continent, bringing devastation wherever their attention landed.",
						"And by then he only had three remaining compatriots, because the adventuring group Vox Machina had already dispatched the blue dragon Brimscythe.",
						"Eventually all the land would hear of these heroes: Vax'ildan, the thief and assassin from Byroden who became the champion of the Matron of Ravens, goddess of death. Vex'ahlia, Vax's twin sister, the broomstick-riding archer who became the champion of the Dawnfather, and her bear companion, Trinket. Percival Fredrickstein von Musel Klossowski de Rolo III, lord of Whitestone and Vex's eventual husband, the deadly marksman and brilliant inventor who built Exandria's first firearms. Keyleth of the Air Ashari, wielder of nature magic, who became the near-immortal Voice of the Tempest. Grog Strongjaw, the hulking half-giant brawler, who forged the weapons that defeated a god. Scanlan Shorthalt, teller of tales, singer of sorcerous songs, and master of the magical mansion, who became the champion of the Knowing Mentor. And Pike Trickfoot, warrior and healer of the Everlight, who brought most of the group back from the dead, some of them multiple times.{@footnote [*]|Taryon Darrington, the arcane builder and author from Wildemount and original spark of inspiration for this book, joined the group after their defeat of the Chroma Conclave. He left a short time later to form the heralded Darrington Brigade.}",
						"Together, wielding force, diplomacy, leadership, and a set of truly legendary arms and armor, Vox Machina slew the remaining four dragons of the Chroma Conclave. It took them only four weeks.",
						"But in those weeks, so much damage had been done. Countless people were dead, thousands of acres of crops were destroyed, supply routes and food stores across the continent were strained to their breaking point. The stability and structure of Tal'Dorei had been turned on its head. Again.",
						"And now, today, is a time of rebuilding in Tal'Dorei. Again. Many find themselves focusing inward, away from the wider world. The year after Thordak and his allies were slain, news arrived: Vox Machina was confronting a lich who threatened the existence of everyone in Exandria. {@i Where is this lich?} the people of Tal'Dorei asked. {@i Across the sea, in Issylra}, came the answer. {@i Well, then}, people responded, {@i we'll worry about that trouble when it gets here}. Since then, a generation of relative quiet has come and gone, but Tal'Dorei has not had nearly enough rest.",
						"This, finally, brings us to the food of Tal'Dorei today, and we are honored to bring you the recipes that follow. From Whitestone in the north to the Rifenmist Jungle in the south, we have gathered dishes of every size, from a quick snack to a breakfast feast. Tal'Dorei's grand institution of greasy pub food is of course represented. The bounty of Tal'Dorei's lush forests is referenced with several instances of tree nuts, though we have limited ourselves to the common varieties and would not recommend delving into the Verdant Expanse in search of fey-touched food. Even the Great Feathering gets a nod, as we feature chicken in several of our selections (though poultry has also become trendy on the continent in recent decades, after word spread that Scanlan Shorthalt was partial to it).",
						"But those are just ingredients, and what ties Tal'Dorei cuisine together is more a matter of culture. For that, let's return to contemplating everyone's favorite historically themed dinner theater. Because A Taste of Tal'Dorei, when you get down to it, understands the continent it is celebrating.",
						"Amid the spectacle and the breading, the thing that A Taste of Tal'Dorei gets most right is the emphasis on comfort. {@i Enjoy your drinks. Pack in the food. It's been hard out there, and it will be hard again. The rest will never last long enough, not nearly. But in here, while we're eating, it's okay. Hoist that souvenir tankard high. We will all survive the Rimelord's frozen death.}",
						"And so, we invite you to make these meals in the same spirit. Whether it's pastries or pies, meat or mayonnaise, we hope these dishes can bring you a moment of respite in a rough world, a taste of Tal'Dorei in a troubled time. Cheers.",

								"After halting an evil god's incursion into the Lightless Lands Below, joining the Vasselheim hunting guild the Slayer's Take, liberating the city of Whitestone from the rule of Delilah and Sylas Briarwood, defeating five dragons, and along the way, resurrecting their party members from death ten separate times, the heroes of Vox Machina needed a break from adventuring. But they found that they couldn't sit idle. So half of the team\u2014Vex'ahlia, Pike, Keyleth, and Taryon\u2014decided to use their skills at hunting fearsome beasts, channeling the divine, harnessing the elements, and building robots to...open a bakery. The result was the Slayer's Cake in Whitestone!",
								"The bakery's opening seasons were somewhat {@footnote bumpy,*|One notable bump: the time their new hire turned out to be a bounty hunter who promptly kidnapped Taryon.} but the renown of its founders and the ongoing refinements to their recipes paid off. The Slayer's Cake is now loved across Tal'Dorei and beyond. Even though the bakery is branching out into new territories, access to its wares is still limited: if you can't get to Whitestone, Emon, or Nicodranas, you're out of luck.",
								"Until now.",
								"Here you will find the original, proprietary recipes for three of the Slayer's Cake's most notable delicacies. The spicy smoothness of Sun Treats. The tangy creaminess of Everlight-as-Air Scones. And, of course, the nutty deliciousness of Trinket's Bear Claws (with a cinnamon kick, if you prefer them Nicodranas-style).

Repeat this two additional times until all of the heavy cream has been added and the mixture has come together to form a shaggy dough. Use your hands to gently bring the dough together, but do not overwork the dough (a few dry patches in the dough is fine).",

Cut the dough into eight equal wedges. Separate the wedges and arrange on the prepared baking sheet. Refrigerate for 20 minutes.",

						"Over medium heat, cook the mixture, whisking constantly, until it is very steamy and thickened to the consistency of a rich pudding, 7 to 10 minutes. Taste the curd to ensure that there is no taste of raw cornstarch (if there is, continue to cook for a couple more minutes), then remove from the heat and add the butter, a couple of pieces at a time, whisking well after each addition.",

Press plastic wrap directly onto the surface to prevent a skin from forming, and cool at room temperature for 15 minutes. Transfer to the refrigerator and chill until the curd is completely set, at least 2 hours and up to 7 days."
