								"In the foreword to the cookbook that ties into the world of {@i Game of Thrones}\u2014yep, such a book exists\u2014George R. R. Martin decided to reveal a secret. He admitted, in hushed tones, that he kind of... can't cook. \"There 'tis,\" he wrote, \"my shameful secret.\" He did, however, declare\u2014perhaps unnecessarily, as it's indisputable\u2014that he excels at writing. About food, too. So well about the latter, in fact, as to cause his readers to salivate profusely. {@i I have in the arsenal at my fingertips}, George announced in so many words, {@i what every writer truly needs:} \"Big, meaty nouns, crisp, fresh verbs, and a nice seasoning of adjectives and adverbs.\"",
								"I couldn't agree more. We may, nonetheless, take a moment to commiserate with Martin. He enjoys food\u2014as do I. This is obvious from his eminently Epicurean physique\u2014as is mine. But if he had a hankering for Dornish \"Duck with Lemons\" or \"Trout Wrapped in Bacon\" from the aforementioned cookbook, someone else would likely need to prepare them for him. He alone may not manage.",
								"As for myself\u2014to say it once and for all time\u2014I don't have this problem. Bah, in addition to savoring his words, I've done the same with the dishes from his world. I've already cooked the trout as well as the Dornish duck. I managed just fine with the \"Honeyed Chicken\" hailing from Winterfell, too. Next, I plan to make and serve the \"Quails Drowned in Butter\" from King's Landing. And I'm sure to go on to cook many other Westerosi dishes.",
								"Indeed, dear readers, I can cook. I know how to, and I enjoy doing it. And I don't mind boasting that there are few culinary mysteries to which I'm not privy. Wearing an apron, chef's knife in hand, I fear no creature, no fish, no fowl, no vegetable. It also seems I manage just fine with writing. My nouns aren't lean and dry, my adverbs are far from bland, and my adjectives, well, they're hardly of the garden variety. And when I write about food or its preparation, believe you me, I know the whats, hows, and whys. I'd say I'm thoroughly versed in them, in fact.",
								"I'm fully aware this book has more to do with the games than it does with {@i my} work, but I'd wager gamers retain an interest in fantasy literature\u2014in books and in how they come to be. But what the hell, this is my foreword, so I'll write what I please.",
								"A fundamental trait of the fantasy genre is something I like to call \"the realism of the unreal.\" As it describes worlds and events drawn from myth, legends, or fairy tales, {@i fantasy} breaks completely free of the fairy-tale paradigm, negating the unreal while simultaneously suspending rationality. It forces readers to immerse themselves in the world of a story and accept said world as real.",
								"My approach to making my fantasy neverland real was first and foremost through its economies. I was careful to shape economic issues to be both relevant and credible. Industries small and large, craftsmanship, farming, mining, trade and trade policies, monetary and fiscal mechanisms, banking, money, and financial operations\u2014I granted all these a prominent place in my \"unreality\" in order, in fact, to render it real. Because, even in our reality, what is more real than economies? People, be it in our world or fantasy worlds, have to make a living.",
								"And to live they must eat.",
								"I understood economics because I had made it my field of study. As to cooking\u2014I knew both how to do it and I liked doing it. To write about what one knows and what one enjoys... is there anything easier?",
								"All\u2014or nearly all\u2014of the culinary descriptions in my {@i Witcher} universe sprang from events in my own life. They're tied to memories\u2014oft of the nostalgic variety. And I wrote them, I admit, with the ignoble intent of eliciting a Pavlovian response in readers: to make their mouths water, their stomachs rumble.",
								"Take Queen Calanthe's feast in \"A Question of Price.\" Seated at a palace banquet table, Geralt wrestles with the shell of an enormous {@i ociężnik} (tran. crayfish or lobster). Hats off to any who know that {@i ociężnik} is an old Polish word for a langouste. Countless times I myself have wrestled with the shells of lobsters and other shellfish\u2014their bits taking to the air on many an occasion.",
								"In \"The Bounds of Reason,\" Geralt and Borkh Three Jackdaws treat themselves to some crayfish. It's a moment of personal culinary nostalgia. I have childhood memories going back, {@i ahem,} about seventy years... of large hauls of crustaceans and the feasts that followed. Hundreds of huge, red crayfish piled on tables, crayfish soup topped with crayfish croutons. I could go on... But those days are gone. As is {@i Astacus astacus}, the noble crayfish. For all practical purposes the species is extinct in our corner of Europe. If it hasn't vanished entirely just yet, the day fast approaches when it will.",
								"In the fifth novel of the {@i Witcher} series, {@i Lady of the Lake}, we have a feast hosted by Duchess Anarietta of Toussaint. At the center of the table lies an overgrown sterlet, a roasted heron on its back, a gold ring in the heron's beak. No, I won't pretend that I've ever prepared such a lavish display. Rather, I borrowed the roasted heron and the knightly vows made upon it from Maurice Druon's {@i The Accursed Kings}.",
								"But that table in Toussaint was also laden with mistle thrushes and fieldfares. Once hunted for sport, both these bird species are now protected. Serious hunters looked down on them as game. Yet they were eagerly hunted by youths wielding bolt-action rifles that took shells the size of cigarette filters, filled with shot the size of poppy seeds. You don't see rifles like this anymore, and to try these small fowl you must travel to Italy, where they're available in stores and served up at fine restaurants.",
								"I drew the crowning touch of the duchess's banquet, the {@i Magna bestia}\u2014a formidable roast moose\u2014from Zygmunt Gloger's {@i Old Polish Encyclopedia}. It is said this same dish was served at many a feast in Polish magnate homes. Annals contend that Stanisław Lubomirski, a nobleman, served something similar at a feast held during Polish-Swedish negotiations in 1635. I truly wonder how that looked. What's certain is that preparing a meal of this magnitude in today's kitchens would be simply impossible. Even in Sweden, where moose are still hunted and consumed.",
								"{@i Season of Storms,} too, incorporates its fair share of culinary curios. In the novel, Geralt makes his way to the {@i Natura Rerum}, an inn renowned for its kitchen. I compiled its menu from real recipes. As regards the \"Turbot in Squid Ink\" recommended to Geralt, I can claim to have made it myself, both ingredients being readily available these days. For anyone interested, turbot is a challenge to gut, clean, and fillet. But get it done, and you can look forward to something delicious.",
								"The sardines Dandelion and Geralt dine on in Kerack are a Portuguese specialty known as {@i sardinhas assadas.} While Milan, Italy, is where I had to go to find the fish soup Dandelion offers Geralt in the port. To cobble together this soup, one must invest a bit of effort and go to some trouble. The trouble is the tub gurnard, a fish from the {@i Triglidae} family. It's essential to the recipe, the soup is simply not the same without it.",
								"And then there's the dwarven rustic potato soup (Polish: {@i zalewajka}) described in one of Eleanor Rhundurin-Pigott's famed cookbooks. {@i Perfect Mahakaman Cuisine: The Precise Science of Preparing Meat, Fish and Vegetable Dishes}... is, mind you, a nonexistent book, entirely made up. To ask for it at a bookstore would be about as sensible as asking for a copy of the {@i Necronomicon}. That said, the soup itself is one hundred percent real. It's a traditional Polish soup, rooted in the times of our {@i Promised Land}{@cite Promised Land - Łódź|TWOC|*}, consumed as it was by the textile workers of the Scheibler, Geyer, and Poznański factories. The smell of {@i zalewajka} is the smell of the city of Łódź. It's the smell of my childhood, me, a second-generation {@i Lodzermensch}. The recipe as outlined in {@i Season of Storms} is, BTW, complete and accurate. It can easily be used to prepare the dish. Any capable and thrifty innkeeper could manage it.",
								"It was nice of the authors to honor my original recipe for \"{@recipe Mahakaman Zalewajka|TWOC}\" with a place in this book. I thank them both.",
								"I compiled quite a few fancy dishes\u2014some of them entirely made-up\u2014for the menu of the royal wedding feast in Kerack. I couldn't stop at oysters, sea urchins, sautéed crab, and sea bass with saffron, so I added \"Honeyed Knee of Swan.\" Chronicles of old tell of such \"knees\" being served in Moscow during the coronation banquet of the False Tsar Dmitriy I and his wife Marina Mniszech in 1606. {@i Se non è vero, è ben trovato.} Though they may have been tasty, I'd nevertheless advise leaving swans in peace.",
								"Aaand, almost forgot. I also added \"Grilled Honey-Browned Monkfish\" to the menu of the wedding feast at Kerack. It's a version of an actual dish. Those interested in trying it need only to google the recipe for \"Queue de lotte rôtie au balsamique et miel\" and have at it.",
								"At long last, dear readers, we come to {@i Baptism of Fire} and the fish soup that Geralt and his companions prepare and slurp down on an islet on the Yaruga River. The sheer number of times I've actually made this soup! In my kitchen at home, out in the wild, on fishing trips, on sunny days, under the stars, in rain and snow. In expensive Berghoff pots and in blackened, bubbling campfire cauldrons. I've made it from pike heads, carp, roach, perch, flounder, ruffe, North American catfish and God only knows what else. General rule: start by boiling fish trimmings in a vegetable broth. Strain that thoroughly and add the larger bits from gutting\u2014heads, tails, fins, spines, and bones\u2014to the strained broth. Cook it again to obtain a double broth, which you strain once more. Then add the \"edible\" fish bits\u2014meaning the pieces you actually want to eat\u2014to this strained double broth, and keep cooking to make a tripled-up soup. I'll refrain from listing specific herbs and spices, since {@i de gustibus} and so forth. Just season it richly and make it fiery. You may\u2014after the Hungarian fashion\u2014add a sizable portion of onion fried with good {@i edes fűszerpaprika}. I'll say it again\u2014the soup works just as well around a campfire as it does on a table set for a holiday.",
								"The recipe for \"{@recipe Redanian Fish Soup|TWOC}\" in this book fits nicely within the canon I've delineated. Give it a try\u2014it's worth it!",
								"But I've digressed enough\u2014high time to make something to eat. I think I'll try the \"{@recipe Fried Kaszanka with Egg|TWOC|Fried Kaszanka and Egg}\" described in this book. I get {@i kaszanka} (blood sausage) from my favorite store\u2014it's the real thick Łódź-style blood sausage. Egh, I pity the nations and regions that have never known a thick Łódź {@i kaszanka.} They go about their lives in blissful ignorance. As for mushrooms, I have them on hand\u2014penny buns and other boleti I forage from the Tuchola Forest and then dry. The added egg is, I admit, new to me... I've never had it with {@i kaszanka}. But it's worth trying everything you can, it's worth experimenting\u2014after all, the kitchen is no place for pedants. So I'll go ahead and slap an egg on my blood sausage\u2014call it a nod to the authors of this fine book.",
								"And on that optimistic note, I'll stop. I'm grabbing {@i The Witcher Official Cookbook} and heading to the kitchen."

						"You might not always notice the importance of food in pop culture products, but when culinary motifs are skillfully implemented in stories, they add much more than mere decoration. The finding, making, and eating of food provides relatable insight into a given world and its culture, and into the specific characters doing the finding, making, or eating. Thanks to this, universes gain layers, depth, and believability, promoting greater immersion among the audience. Culinary themes often serve as a backdrop to stories, setting the scene for plots to develop through dialogue and intrigue, or propelling the action forward through countless tavern quarrels and fight scenes during which characters use what's at hand in combat\u2014from cutlery, mugs, bowls, and bottles, to jars of preserve.",

When he lived with Yennefer she would occasionally throw jars of preserve at him in anger. Jars she had received from clients. Yennefer had no idea how to make preserve\u2014her magic was fallible in that respect."

						"In {@i The Witcher} stories\u2014whether written on the page and brought to life in the imagination or visualized on screen\u2014one encounters a familiar yet distorted world composed of various elements drawn from European folklore and culture. Slightly twisted versions of well-known fairy tales and legends, dropped into a fantasy setting, are a hallmark of {@i The Witcher}. These captivating reimaginings of classic stories we dimly remember from childhood form a rich background to the events and problems of the vivid, often morally ambiguous universe Geralt of Rivia explores.",
						"In creating this book, we followed a similar path. Drawing guidance and inspiration from the books and games that have captivated us, we also looked to the folklore and customs of our proverbial backyard, blending them with unique {@i Witcher} accents and a few new topical touches of our own. We allowed ourselves a bit of freedom due to our culinary leitmotif which we emphasized not only through accurately selected and \"placed\" recipes, but also with fictional stories of how our narrator learned them. We found creating these short tales, limited only by our imagination, to be both a joy and a tricky task as we had to adapt our research and inspirations in tasty, entertaining ways, all the while retaining the tone of the literary source.",
						"To tell our stories, we needed the right guide to take you on a journey through the cookbook's pages. Though we added a small sentimental surprise to the last chapter of the book, we deliberately let go of trying to step into a known character's shoes, be it Geralt or Dandelion, and having them, through their prism, lead you through the narrative. We shifted the burden of the story onto another set of shoulders.",
						"Our narrator is a new character, a cartographer from distant Kovir with a penchant for culinary exploration. She is the ideal candidate to be our guide across the Continent, traveling as a tourist with an outlander's perspective. In this sense, she is very much like we are. Because she hasn't been involved in any known previous events, she has the freedom to simply explore these newly visited lands and engage with their inhabitants. Though it may seem as if our narrator becomes embroiled in unusual situations rather often, we believe she credibly fits into the stylings, settings, and events of the expansive {@i Witcher} world. For it is this world's geographic diversity that influenced our book's composition, divided as it is into chapters dedicated to specific regions, each chapter leading you through a given stage of the narrator's journey.",
						{
							"type": "hr"
						},
						"The visual aspect of bringing these stories and recipes to life was equally crucial, thus we put all our passion and commitment into even the smallest detail to reflect the specificity of {@i the Witcher} world for its longtime fans and to showcase it to those just discovering it. We endeavored to capture the ambiance of each place through thematic illustrations, decorative ornaments and, above all, photographs. Some of these elements refer to cultures familiar to us, be it Scandinavian accents on the frosty Skellige Isles or the charming blend of French and Italian stylings as we move into Toussaint. Naturally, the narrator's visits to White Orchard and Velen simply had to feature references to our Polish roots, represented by colorful, regional folkloric elements and Slavic accents.",
						{

						"\"Something Ends, Something Begins\" is a fitting aphorism as our work on this cookbook comes to an end, while for you, dear reader, a culinary journey across the Continent begins. We sincerely hope that what we've produced will be warmly received as a worthy complement to the {@i Witcher} world. The story within strives to take you on a brief, somewhat sentimental journey. Yet you cannot fill your belly with words, so be brave and venture into your own kitchen with this book as your companion to experience for yourselves the rich, we daresay, diversity of flavors and aromas in the cuisine of the {@i Witcher} world."

						"Gaunter O'Dimm, known otherwise as the Man of Glass, proclaimed that in many matters, the culinary arts among them, time is the most important ingredient. It certainly is crucial for this cookbook. Just imagine the tempting smells of a hearty, warm, long-brewed stew served in a roadside tavern after a long journey, pleasantly appeasing your hunger and soothing the stresses of your day with each flavorful bite. So we encourage you to embrace that very concept and the carefree feeling you may get when you have a surfeit of it. Specifically, we encourage you to spend unhurried time in your kitchen enjoying the art of home cooking, and to celebrate time together over meals prepared in the {@i Witcher} style, with this cookbook as your companion.

								"Avoid making several shopping expeditions each time you want to try new recipes by keeping on hand basic pantry ingredients that you can store for longer. We have in mind such things as dried herbs and spices, nuts, dried fruits, dried mushrooms, honey, apple cider vinegar, groats, oils, and flours.",
								"Many of our recipes are inspired by European cuisine and Polish cooking traditions, with ingredients that might be easy enough to find on the Continent but may be less common in your world. Most of these ingredients can be ordered online or found at specialized European delis or natural food markets.",
								"Fresh herbs, especially dill and parsley, are best. As is fresh garlic. Extend the freshness of unused or extra herbs by storing as follows: sprinkle a doubled-up paper towel with water and wrap it around the fresh herbs. Put the wrapped herbs into a plastic bag, seal it, and refrigerate for up to two weeks.",
								"Use white onions unless otherwise specified.",
								"Use starchy, round potatoes rather than russet potatoes, which vary widely in size and shape.",
								"Use all-purpose flour unless otherwise specified. Don't use self-rising flour.",
								"Some dishes or ingredients are traditionally fried in lard, which gives a rich, deep flavor, but you can substitute a neutral vegetable oil (like rapeseed or sunflower) for frying if you prefer the taste.",
								"It's fine to use ground spices in most cases, but we highly recommend using fresh, coarsely ground black pepper and freshly grated nutmeg instead of the finely-ground packaged versions.",

Sometimes we call for more uncommon equipment such as a potato masher, grater, fine-mesh strainer, whisk, tongs, wire rack, mortar and pestle (or you can use a food processor instead), basting or pastry brush, or ovenproof dish with lid. Although not available on the Continent, we also mention some modern conveniences such as electric ovens, aluminum foil, and plastic wrap.",
								"The recipes in this book focus on making dishes from scratch. Some preparations require advance planning and patience, but most are not too labor-intensive. Don't feel discouraged when marinating, fermenting, simmering, or proofing dough is called for\u2014be bold and give them a go! For the times when you need faster results, it's fine to use store-bought workarounds such as broth, pie crust, or pizza dough (for recipes that use yeast-based doughs).",

To sterilize jars for brining cucumbers or making sourdough, thoroughly wash lids and jars with dishwashing liquid and rinse with hot running water.

								"The Continent is a colorful and intricate mosaic of lands, with the numerous variations and shades of its smaller parts combining to create an impressive pattern. It reminds me of a vibrant kitchen\u2014of intermingling tastes and intertwining smells, braided as cultures are across regions and localities in everyday life."
							]

						"Every country has its customs, and every family has its traditions. Once upon a time, my relatives began regularly collecting kitchen notes\u2014about all sorts of dishes, from simple home recipes to those learned on journeys to far-off lands. Over many years, these loose pages turned into a bulging volume full of culinary family secrets handed down from generation to generation, a trove of priceless wealth holding traces of the past, present, and possibly the future\u2014so, a kind of eternity. It has always been a sentimental keepsake for me, a connection to the heart of my home: the kitchen and the family table there. This kitchen table\u2014thick and solid, made from sturdy oak, equipped with drawers and compartments\u2014may be a bit worn and a little cracked across its surface, but it has been a faithful family companion through everyday meals and evening feasts alike. It's an enchanted place where we are transported to various corners of the Continent ... both by tales languidly told and the flavors and smells of the dishes in our recipe collection.",
						"There was some space left in our family cookbook\u2014empty pages waiting to be filled with new recipes, ingredients, and culinary stories from beyond the environs of my home in Kovir. Until recently, I could only explore the world with the help of my family's abundant library of maps or my beloved books and volumes of poetry. My favorite among them has always been {@i The Blue Pearl} by Essi \"Oeillet\" Daven\u2014I draw inspiration from the author's beautifully written ballads, and her daring character gives me courage when I face the unknown. This would very much be so when it came time for me to step across my home's doorstep and open a new chapter in the family cookbook for my own journey\u2014a story that I would not have believed possible not long before.",
						"For there came a day when our mapmaking workshop received a commission ... straight from the ducal court of Toussaint, no less! We were to enrich the palace walls there with a tasteful rendering of the known world. There was nothing extraordinary about this in itself; for years, we have been sought out for the meticulous work we produce in our atelier. Occasionally, our expert drafters travel by merchant ship or caravan to clients' elegant halls and chambers to produce their intricate handicrafts on the spot. Yet for the first time, I was entrusted with representing the family and so accepted this invitation to travel due south\u2014from our workshop in Lan Exeter to the palace halls in Beauclair.",
						"At dawn, I boarded a merchant ship in Kovir and crossed the salty sea waves under fluttering sails. Arriving in the bustling port of Novigrad, however, I did not transfer to a vessel that would take me immediately to Beauclair, I simply could not deny myself the pleasure of visiting relatives who have lived within Vizima's walls for years. Nor could I forego the opportunity to extend my journey by several weeks with a view to exploring the neighboring lands and beyond ... Places I had hitherto known only from family tales, the details of which I had chiefly imagined, now lay before me as stops along my journey. I set out to taste new flavors and experience life in every town, village, and tavern I would have the good fortune to visit. I resolved that no mishaps nor even fateful surprises would make me stray from my chosen course, even were it to lead me to where the devil says goodnight. ...",
						"So I followed a trail of delicious foods around the Continent. As my grandpapa is wont to say, the proof of the pudding is in the eating. Rest assured, I did so with gusto, be it along the sandy tracks of the Northern Realms or on the Skelige Isles' frosty, windy shores. And, eventually, indeed, in Toussaint's sun-warmed valleys, at once verdant and golden, amidst the fairy-tale beauty that reigns there.",
						"Though ingredients and recipes were without a doubt my chief interest throughout my journey, the culinary arts draw folk of all sorts. Thus, I also gathered, or at times just overheard, the stories, gossip, and rumors of those who dined beside me. They were travelers and local folk\u2014from fatigued royal messengers and dignified officials, through halfling scholars, carefree bards, and dwarven merchants, to even the occasional assimilated elf. And if innkeepers are to be believed in the rumors they proffer, their patrons at times included more mysterious figures oft concealed beneath hoods\u2014mages, sorceresses, or the monster slayers known as witchers. ...",

								"To satisfy these longings I needed but a bit of courage. Having found this, I went on to enjoy the culinary wonders of distant lands and to discover with my own palate positively captivating recipes offering flavorful surprises.",

Those who live there call it \"White Orchard\" in a simple yet elegant tribute to the abundance of blossoming trees and flowering shrubs. This abundance influences the area's cuisine and has helped it rise to prominence. For a taste of White Orchard's distinctive fare, one need only cross the threshold of the hamlet's lone inn\u2014as all passing travelers do. The ways of rural life ought never to be underestimated, and trusting one's nose is crucial. My own followed the intoxicating scent of flowers and aroma of freshly baked goods ... The innkeeps lack expensive, exotic spices, yet they produce unforgettable meals using just local ingredients. As the harvested crops change with the seasons, so too do the specialties served. It's a rhythm as languid and unhurried as the flow of the Ismena River passing over the mill's rickety water wheel ...",

Guarded by the old oak Rarog, king of the local forest, the crossing reeked of damp that had wafted in from the region's mist-shrouded swamps. Unsurprisingly, local superstition holds this scrap of land to be teeming with mysterious netherworldly forces. But for some wayfarers, a different face of Velen peers through the haze of dust churned up by horses' hooves: one speckled with wooden cottages, tidy pastures and fields cultivated by generations of persistent farmers. Over time, villages in the region began to exchange goods and wares in a show of neighborly support, much to the benefit of Velen's simple cuisine. Once limited in terms of ingredients, dishes throughout the region soon evolved, while ever retaining enough unique rustic flavor to invigorate and delight any city-dweller's palate.

								"Folk tales of birds abound in the North, and Velen proved no exception. Storks nesting on rooftops or swallows building dwellings within homestead walls are not pests, but marks of good fortune. A sharp eye, however, will note that alongside such lucky omens many buildings bear the scars of raids and wars. Yet these less peaceful and less prosperous times gave rise to some beloved local recipes as well. Their hand forced by circumstance, resourceful locals from Lindenvale and nearby villages nonetheless concocted filling dishes using only the simplest ingredients. For example, this sauerkraut and pea stew. Customarily boiled in a large cauldron, the rich stew is meant to last for days. It is oft served with dumplings or bread, while in happier, more abundant years it is enriched with bacon. In Velen, in these times, one might find a small, scrumptious portion left out in a clay pot for household sprites\u2014kind imps that, in exchange for food and shelter, come nightfall help with daily chores.",

A specialty from the village of Blackbough, this bread owes its singular flavor to the addition of beer, fried onion and\u2014perhaps surprisingly\u2014leftover mashed potatoes. One bite of the filling, aromatic loaf vanquished any initial doubts I may have had regarding the unusual combination. Velenese villagers also believe carrying a loaf while traveling wards off evil and brings fortuitous luck. I must admit the bread did indeed bring me good fortune once I had resumed my journey. Two nights after my departure, my horse's sensitive ears and sudden snorting warned me that nekkers had crept near my camp.

The inn's specialty, the drink was originally concocted to distinguish the establishment's fare from the watered-down beer typically served at neighboring taverns. There are times, however, when an inn's prosperity depends not on the variety of victuals on its menu, but on more unusual stratagems. In the case of the Crossroads 'twas a lucky charm fashioned from a piece of a hanged man's rope! The rumor was that the innkeep's relatives would dip the rope into the roasted grain infusion, believing that whosoever tasted a drink thus \"seasoned\" would be certain to return for another round. Despite my reservations about this practice and doubts as to its efficacy, fatigue, and thirst drove me to follow the other guests in draining my tankard to the last satisfying drop.",

At the time of my visit, the hut's occupant was Yagna, who had a black rooster as her companion and clearly no patience as a cook. While ferreting through items left behind by a sorceress predecessor of hers (some signed by \"Keira M.\" in an elegant hand), Yagna had discovered a recipe for an exquisite beef stew. Yet her hungry ambition to sample the recipe's promised fusion of dry Zurbarràn wine and Zerrikanian spices seemed doomed to go unsatisfied, so chaotic were her attempts at it. Until our chance meeting, that is. I never travel without a collection of critical provisions and have never seen any reason not to share my knowledge. So I imparted a few kitchen tips and shared several sachets straight from the Zerrikanian Spice Company in Novigrad, and soon I had turned from Yagna's unannounced guest into her culinary savior.

The over-large oven in the corner, however, did make me wonder if this kind-hearted granny's dessert was not merely meant to fatten me up."

				"When I reached the Inn at the Crossroads, I found it awash in the red glow of the setting sun. Naturally, I longed for something cold to refresh my parched throat after a full day in the saddle. As luck would have it, the inn offered a lovely bittersweet drink made of pale lager, apple juice, and a splash of roasted grain infusion. The inn's specialty, the drink was originally concocted to distinguish the establishment's fare from the watered-down beer typically served at neighboring taverns. There are times, however, when an inn's prosperity depends not on the variety of victuals on its menu, but on more unusual stratagems. In the case of the Crossroads 'twas a lucky charm fashioned from a piece of a hanged man's rope! The rumor was that the innkeep's relatives would dip the rope into the roasted grain infusion, believing that whosoever tasted a drink thus \"seasoned\" would be certain to return for another round. Despite my reservations about this practice and doubts as to its efficacy, fatigue, and thirst drove me to follow the other guests in draining my tankard to the last satisfying drop."

These sweet, richly decorated gingerbread cookies, baked by local housewives, vary in shape and hue depending on the spices within. Children especially love that these tempting delicacies dangle from colorful threads and ribbons, and just barely within reach of their fingertips. Yet the sweet objects of desire are said to be guarded by the sinister Ladies of the Wood, out to snare the more mischievous of the children. How did such an unusual custom arise among the inhabitants of the recently rebuilt village? And do the evil Crones of remote Crookback Bog actually snatch children wandering down the sweet-lined path? The stories surrounding this custom fade as time passes and change as they migrate to distant places. In one instance they are said to have inspired a folk tradition whereby villagers dress up in costumes fashioned from straw! Imagine! Yet, well-seasoned reader of stories that I am, I can say even the most improbable story almost always contains a grain of truth."

Thus, a few loaves of local, freshly baked bread found their way into my saddlebags. A specialty from the village of Blackbough, this bread owes its singular flavor to the addition of beer, fried onion and\u2014perhaps surprisingly\u2014leftover mashed potatoes. One bite of the filling, aromatic loaf vanquished any initial doubts I may have had regarding the unusual combination. Velenese villagers also believe carrying a loaf while traveling wards off evil and brings fortuitous luck. I must admit the bread did indeed bring me good fortune once I had resumed my journey. Two nights after my departure, my horse's sensitive ears and sudden snorting warned me that nekkers had crept near my camp. I lobbed the hearty loaf I'd been enjoying at the monsters' nether paws, giving my mount and me the time we needed to make our escape."

In Mahakam, as dwarven tradition dictates, the soup is served with no cream, yet beyond the region generous dollops are added to satisfy the human palate. In the thick, sourdough broth fragrant with smoked meat and marjoram, one usually finds a variety of ingredients\u2014mushrooms, velvety potato chunks, strips of fried onion, thick bacon bits, even slices of smoked sausage. While gathering information on this soup, I also received a piece of dwarven advice the inn's human cook, Klara, once received and took to heart: \"Tradition deserves respect, sweetheart, but outside Mahakam experiment as you please ... hungry diners will always eat!\""

As regional custom would have it, \"Guests in the house are gods in the house.\" Their humble dwelling stood fragrant with resinous wood, dust, and a savory golden decoction bubbling enticingly on the whitewashed stove. The cottage's wooden shutters and beams groaned softly as the wet weather outside heightened my desire for a few sips of what I hoped would prove a delicious, warming soup. As it turned out, the hearty broth of meat, vegetables, and herbs owed its flavor to the vegetables being roasted and to a splash of vinegar. Served with a generous helping of tender noodles made by the ealdorman's wife, the soup's aroma whisked me back to my grandmother's cozy homestead, a memory I will forever hold dear."

Suddenly, a rapidly approaching storm forced us to take shelter within the miller's home, where we hurriedly covered all mirrors with cloth so as not to glimpse an apparition or other terrifying spirit summoned by the tempest. The fresh, damp air mingled with the irresistible aromas of a bubbling cabbage stew with dried plums and apples and of bread baked from newly milled flour. The miller's cheerful wife served us this nourishing dish, consisting of local fruit mixed with sauerkraut, tender meat, earthy forest mushrooms, and pungent spices.

Yet these less peaceful and less prosperous times gave rise to some beloved local recipes as well. Their hand forced by circumstance, resourceful locals from Lindenvale and nearby villages nonetheless concocted filling dishes using only the simplest ingredients. For example, this sauerkraut and pea stew. Customarily boiled in a large cauldron, the rich stew is meant to last for days. It is oft served with dumplings or bread, while in happier, more abundant years it is enriched with bacon. In Velen, in these times, one might find a small, scrumptious portion left out in a clay pot for household sprites\u2014kind imps that, in exchange for food and shelter, come nightfall help with daily chores."

At the time of my visit, the hut's occupant was Yagna, who had a black rooster as her companion and clearly no patience as a cook. While ferreting through items left behind by a sorceress predecessor of hers (some signed by \"Keira M.\" in an elegant hand), Yagna had discovered a recipe for an exquisite beef stew. Yet her hungry ambition to sample the recipe's promised fusion of dry Zurbarràn wine and Zerrikanian spices seemed doomed to go unsatisfied, so chaotic were her attempts at it. Until our chance meeting, that is. I never travel without a collection of critical provisions and have never seen any reason not to share my knowledge. So I imparted a few kitchen tips and shared several sachets straight from the Zerrikanian Spice Company in Novigrad, and soon I had turned from Yagna's unannounced guest into her culinary savior.
