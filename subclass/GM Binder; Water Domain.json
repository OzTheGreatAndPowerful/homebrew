				"The gods of the rivers, lakes, rains, and seas vary from wrathful storm lords to gentle life bringers. The more violent gods of storms hold sway over the Tempest domain, but the gods of sea life, healing waters, flowing rivers, and blessings of rain belong to another domain: Water. These gods can include beings like Anuket of Egypt, Glaucus of Greece, Chaac of the Maya, Habbakuk from Dragonlance, Eldath from the Forgotten Realms, and Obad-Hai from Greyhawk. The priests of these deities bless fishermen with safety and a plentiful catch and farmers with rain for a strong harvest, utilize the life-giving waters to cleanse disease and heal the sick, and protect the sanctity of the rivers, lakes, and seas as well as the creatures that reside there. Don't confuse this peaceful nature with pacifism, though, as Water clerics will defend their charges, violently if need be.",
