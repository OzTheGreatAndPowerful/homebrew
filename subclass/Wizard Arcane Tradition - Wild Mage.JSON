							"Whether this unofficial school of magic was created through a desire to become the most powerful or out of sheer madness, wild magic is perhaps the most misunderstood and confusing method of magic. Wild Magic is understanding the raw powers of arcane energy itself, trying to harness it to the fullest, and seeing where the energy takes you as a result. For obvious reasons, this school of magic faces more persecution than the necromancy school.",
							"With the discovery of wild magic has come to the attention of wizards devoted to its study. Like their traditional specialist brethren, wild mages have thrown themselves into the intense study of a single aspect of magic. This has given them unique benefits and restrictions of their powers. Wild magic is so different from the traditional schools of magic that only those devoted to its study may cast wild magic; no wizard other than a wild mage may attempt to use the spells of wild magic. Wild Mages are by no means specialist wizards--at least not in the traditional sense. Wild mages do not study within the confines of schools. Instead, their research into new theories of wild magic carries them into all different fields. The proponents of wild magic proudly trumpet their art's broad base and flexibility as its great advantages. Of course, these same advocates are quick to downplay wild magic's drawbacks. First and foremost, it is wild magic. On rare occasions, any spell can have dangerously unpredictable results, including backfiring or creating an entirely different effect from what was desired. More commonly, the magnitude of a spell--range, duration, the area of effect, or even damage--may fluctuate from casting to casting. Spells cast by wild mages are inherently unpredictable.",
							"While there are no restrictions to the alignment of a Wild Mage. Once taken the character's alignment shifts to the nearest chaotic alignment.",
