If you die while your phylactery exists, and you are on the same plane as your phylactery, you reform adjacent to your phylactery after 24 hours. If you are resurrected by some other means before this time, you do not reform via your phylactery. When your phylactery has you reform, a new body is created for you, and your old body disintegrates into dust. The objects and clothing on the person of your old body are unaffected, but your new body is formed without any of the objects your old body possessed.",
