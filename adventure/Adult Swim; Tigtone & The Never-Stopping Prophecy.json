Under his control, nature becomes a veritable death trap, more than compensating for Blassamangenguro’s immobility. Quite a few vampire hunters have met their end when, overconfident, they confront the flower vampire, believing him an easy mark due to his immobile nature. But Blassamangenguro still lives, and the botanical denizens of his lair remain well sated, their soil fertilized with blood and bone."
