								"{@i The Scarlet Citadel} is a relatively straightforward adventure for players and the GM, but levels of the complex are connected both by key story elements and stairs. You'll also need to understand the relationships between inhabitants to get the most from this material.",
								"The unifying villain of the Scarlet Citadel is Gellert the Gruesome, last (or nearly last) scion of the noble family of Holzanger, who built the citadel and once ruled the surrounding territory. Gellert dwells deep in the catacombs, where he can conduct his research on Void magic and the manipulation of ley energy in perfect seclusion. He's not, however, entirely cut off from the world. Powerful figures on other levels of the dungeon serve as his lieutenants in the underworld and as his liaisons to the surface world. Everything living beneath the Scarlet Citadel fears Gellert's power to one extent or another, though few have ever met the legendary sorcerer face-to-face.",

Over the decades it has been used as a hideout by bandits and as a base of operations for adventurers exploring the area. Currently, it's been taken over by harpies that live in the basement of the main keep. They drive away most would-be heroes and sometimes terrorize nearby farms and logging camps. The harpies also throw their scraps to the owlbears that prowl the territory. The occasional presence of those predators contributes to keeping the crumbling fort free of curious interlopers."

The current chief occupants of this level are a psychotic, sadistic torturer and serial killer known locally as the Gaoler, along with a handful of equally twisted creatures that serve him. The Gaoler has no connection with Gellert the Gruesome, who tolerates his presence as a deterrent to explorers.",

Even the Gaoler avoids the crypts and guards against incursions from wandering undead."

Ironically, this section of shadow road coincides with a subterranean river, making the cult's metaphoric label literally true in this locale. In the manner of most theologically driven zealots, the cultists fixated on that accident of nature and invested it with an importance far beyond its simple symbolic coincidence. They carved a temple to their dark god into the caverns surrounding the river and set about their grim worship.",

Conflicts followed inevitably, until eventually the Void cultists declared the temple theirs and made it clear Charun's adherents were not welcome and wouldn't be tolerated.",

Another example would be holes in the wall with scorch marks around them; flames must shoot out of those holes.

Thoroughly investigating a 25-foot-square room, for example, takes about 40 minutes (25 minutes for the floor plus 20 minutes for the walls minus a few minutes to account for obvious doorways).",
								"The time can be shortened by having multiple characters search different areas. In that case, each searcher makes an independent Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check for their own area.",
								"{@skill Investigation} reveals more than {@skill Perception} does. A successful Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check of a trap reveals the trigger and any understandable details about its effect. For example, the investigator might learn that stepping on {@i this} flagstone causes {@i that} wall panel to open, but it's impossible to know what's behind the wall panel without opening it. Successful investigation of a secret door reveals the door's location and how to open it.",
								"{@skill Perception} isn't useless in these situations, but all a successful Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check produces is a suspicion about the area, a knowing that something in it is {@i wrong}.

Imortra doesn't care about the Gaoler or any undead in the crypt, so her initial reaction is nothing more than telling Cagoth-ze to deal with it.

								"The castle now called the Scarlet Citadel sits on the site of an ancient elven hunting lodge in the White Forest, claimed by a noble family after the Great Retreat 400-some years ago. The land was thus owned by House Holzanger, who owed fealty at various times to Illyria, the Republic of Triolo, the Canton of Melana, and (most often) to the Magdar Kingdom. Always rather deft in politics and inclined to an unambitious policy of, \"Just leave us alone with our books and hawks and hunting,\" House Holzanger might have remained a footnote if it were not for their control of the Scarlet Crow ley line and their willingness to annoy the fey lords and ladies of the forest.",
								"Originally, the pretty lodge was visited each summer and fall for boar hunts, chasing deer in the White Forest, and fish-hawking along the Templine riverbanks. The family realized the road to the lodge could also be utilized for timber transport, so the lodge became the manor for a new lumber village along the river. The lodge itself remained a place of blissful seclusion, though with some ability to gather servitors, various goods, and skilled craftspeople from the village.",
								"This village was named Redleaf. At first, they sold their finest oak, ash, and rowan either east to the city of Melana or north to the Magdar merchants for barrels, barge masts, and much else. The trade was not without problems (the forest fey included some alseid and bothersome druids), but in all, it was a worthwhile little fiefdom for the Holzangers. Over time, the village grew, and then Gerhardt Holzanger came along, the first of the Holzanger sorcerers."

The ley line itself seemed to pool and gather strength near the hunting lodge more than at the village itself, and the isolated lodge was a good place for experiments that often involved chanting, arcane lights, and the strange smells of alchemical enhancements and distillations.",
								"Gerhardt kept his secret for almost ten years until he took an apprentice who later ran away to Schio and told his tale. A ley line that might connect other ley lines! Ley-line philters and encasements that reacted to Void power, radiant magic, and shadow! Ley-line distillations that gave his cruel master much added strength of body and mind! The tales were wild and had the effect that the apprentice Waldmer intended\u2014the privacy of the White Forest Lodge was a thing of the past.",
								"With the wider understanding of the discovery, the area was suddenly of interest to geomancers, the shadow fey, and darker forces who wished to travel the fey roads between the three lines, plumb the mysteries of why",
								"this backwater might connect ley lines in this way, and discover how this strong ley line might be harnessed. The first few visitors were greeted politely and told to go away. Later visitors were treated as foes. Over the years, the hunting lodge\u2014at the ley line's strongest point\u2014was rebuilt with the red stone common to the area, first as a single tower and then as a small keep.",
								"Arcane secrets were under frequent investigation. Gerhardt Holzanger grew rich taking on various comely, cunning, and willing apprentices (some believe Arshin the Enchanter\u2014see {@i Warlock #2} {@note #TODO BREW-691}\u2014was one of them, more long-lived than most) and having built his redstone castle on the site of the ley line's greatest resonance and generally making the most of it. He bound himself to the ley line, giving himself and his children greater strength in using its magic but also making it difficult to wander far from the Wandering Crow. At first, he could travel as far as Zigistad, Melana, and Triolo itself, but over time, this narrowed to Peltzenheim and the town of Erdovar (before its ruin) and Schio. Some believe this same ritual binds the master of Demon Mountain to his own domicile, granting him great power in a highly limited space."

Within the reach of the White Forest, first Gerhardt the Elder and then Gerhardt the Younger and then Gertruda and Gunthar and Gerhardt III all had control over the ley lines, countering any foe or assassin skillfully, inventing new ways to charm a friend or turn an enemy into a bug. Over generations, their interests delved deep into newts and amphibians, and then the family became obsessed with horology, celestial mechanics, flotation and levitation, night creatures, angelic languages, and on and on.

A few dwarves though, especially those of Nordmansch and Alpentor, still hew to the older ways, forging rings of surpassing power and loveliness, alive with the circling strength of runes, binding raw arcane might and turning it to fire and shadow, to glamours as durable as stone.",
								"These dwarves, the ring wardens and the ring mystics, are the keepers of lore said to have been handed down by bearded Wotan himself. Their understanding of embodying magic in physical form is rarely surpassed, and they took a keen interest in House Holzanger. When the human house was weak, they showed up one day, told Gerhardt III they would be his new soldiers and providers, and somehow either charmed him (some say the gift of an enchanted ring secured Gerhardt III's cooperation) or won him through bribery (others say the ring mystics shared their secrets of binding arcane essences into circular form and that Gerhardt himself forged dozens of powerful rings in this manner).",
								"In either case, suddenly there was a company of one hundred dwarves and a half-dozen ring mages in the village of Redleaf\u2014and many arguments with the locals over the paucity of ale and proper sausages. The dwarves chased down and tamed owlbears as hunting animals and guardians for the newly built Dwarf Hall in the village, a fine dwarven-style structure with a lookout tower. A palisade was raised to protect the village from woodland raiders. And relations between villagers and dwarves never improved. The dwarves followed Ninkash a bit too closely, often drunk and pissing in the streets or singing their endless songs late at night. The dwarven hall was a bit too fine and too imposing. Brawls were common, though the humans had much the worst of it. Complaints to Baron Gerhardt went unheeded. The owlbears ate local goats and chickens and even a beloved dog.",
								"One night, while most of the dwarves were digging at the old Scarlet Manor Hall, the Dwarf Hall burned to the ground. The streets of the village of Redleaf glowed brightly, and the humans sang their own songs of Khors. Some of the Redleaf druids and doughtier men-at-arms mused about throwing the dwarves out entirely and \"rescuing\" Baron Gerhardt from their evil influences.",
								"Baron Gerhardt finally saw the danger of further strife between the humans and dwarves. He called the dwarves to stay at the manor house and keep and told them to build it into a finer citadel with a new name: the Scarlet Citadel. The owlbears left the village of Redleaf to live with the dwarves, coming to the riverside village only occasionally when the baron's dwarves came calling. These grim-faced dwarves came twice a year to collect taxes or gather up barrels of ale from Peltzenheim or to send furs to their dwarven brothers in Melana and Brescia. The dungeons beneath the Scarlet Citadel were vastly expanded and improved to include owlbear stables, barracks, shrines to dwarven gods, and a vast library and workspace carved out for the Holzangers.",
								"The dwarves brought more than rings and owlbears to the Scarlet Citadel. They also brought the faith of Charun the Boatman with them from Melana, and over time, they connected some elements of the citadel with the Black River of Tears, sacred to Charun and said to be a source of connection between the mortal world and Yggdrasil or between Midgard and the many realms of the outer planes."

								"About 130 years ago, the dwarves of the Scarlet Citadel grew impatient with what seemed like plentiful coin and ale, plus the fine magical treasures they occasionally gained from the Holzangers. Tired of hunting and guarding and drinking, and led by the canny Captain Chansar the Pale, they began to take empty carts pulled by enormous tamed owlbears out to the Schio-Wagenstein Road where they plundered merchants and rolled away with fine steel from Melana, copper bars, leather hides from Trombei, spices from Triolo, barrels of salt fish from Friula, and strings of Septime coin. This banditry was small at first\u2014a trader here, a lone peddler there\u2014but it quickly grew into a business of serious danger for trade between the Seven Cities and the Crossroads.",
								"Trade is always dangerous of course, especially among the Septime cities, so the usual precautions were taken. Merchants hired guards, which slowed the banditry but made some trade quite difficult; the price of salt fish won't support a squadron of lancers. Rewards were posted.",
								"For years, various cantonal dwarves and the dwarves of Melana were blamed, for the canny dwarves of the Scarlet Citadel displayed shields and banners of Tijino, Juralt, and Melana or of famous mercenary companies within the Seven Cities. In time, however, it became clear these dwarves lived to the east of the road, and they operated from some stronghold in the White Forest. Given the notorious strength of the forest's owlbears and the well-known dangers of the sorcerers of the Scarlet Citadel taking offense at trespassers, the merchants all agreed that someone else should seek out the bandit stronghold and put a stop to the whole mess. The rewards grew larger.",
								"The end of the bandit era came in a different way when canny Captain Chansar bragged a bit too loudly at Redleaf 's tavern, the Cage. A young squire of the Faithful Knights of Khors was visiting the village as part of a simple devotional journey to the shrine there, and she overheard this boasting about pillaging a full mule train, so Squire Emmalyn told her sergeant of the bragging dwarven bandit. The paladins and faithful knights of Khors had recently had one of their own wine shipments from the Smolten Hills plundered by bandits, and the order's commander was incensed. A wing of knights, a squad of the Wands of Khors battle mages, and the high priest of Khors in Zigistad himself all followed the young squire Emmalyn into the White Forest to Redleaf village and then to the citadel.",
								"When the dwarves refused to hand over Captain Chansar and his accomplices to the king's justice and the mercy of Khors, the knights laid siege to the citadel for a month. In time, owlbears within the citadel ate all there was to eat, and canny Chansar sent the starving beasts out the citadel gate, expecting to make short work of the knights. He was quite mistaken; High Priest Tadeas Toller struck the owlbears with holy fire, the Wands of Khors unleashed lightning, and the countercharge carried the knights into the citadel courtyard.",
								"The battle might yet have gone to the dwarves with their crossbows firing into the courtyard from well- built arrow slits if not for the fine timbers of the keep catching fire when a lucky fireball went through an arrow slit into the interior. The Scarlet Citadel floors, stairs, rafters, and tapestries burned bright and strong, and the conflagration quickly poured smoke into the buildings, the dungeons, and the courtyard. It became impossible to shoot through the smoke and soon to breathe within the tower. The smoke and flames drove a few dwarves into the deeper tunnels, though most were forced to surrender to the waiting company of knights. Captain Chansar's body was never found, and his ring mystic lieutenant Valence Hellhand is known to have survived and fled to Nordmansch. The citadel walls still stood, blackened with smoke, and the dungeons below were no longer home to dozens of owlbears.",
								"But the age of the Scarlet Citadel as a functional fortress was over and done, and the cracked, blackened mortar and missing rafters meant the walls themselves were weakened. Soon other inhabitants came to the citadel, and the villagers of Redleaf came to gather up useful stone blocks and take them by wagon to reinforce their own keep and palisade. These scarlet stones were carried for miles and used with care. And one morning, a mysterious red tower was erected, making such a fine impression overlooking the village, which was soon renamed Redtower, and it has kept that name ever since."

								"The sack of the Scarlet Citadel affected the village of Redtower very little indeed. Timber was still cut, some logs rafted down to Triolo to build the fleets, many of the finest timbers going north to the Magdar plain for houses, barrels\u2014all the things for which stout oak, maple, and ash are most prized. A few arcanists came to sniff around at the ruins, though most left quickly once they met the feral owlbears or were vexed by the sprites and pixies and alseid who guarded the forest paths against intruders.",
								"However, one group came not by forest path but by shadow road, powered by the Wandering Crow ley line. These were the cultists of Charun, the boatman between the living and the dead, whose followers took a pilgrimage from Kammae-Straboli along the Black River (as they call their temples' shadow roads) and wound up underneath the citadel. The whole company of pilgrims was quite confused at first, but the shadow-fey wizard Quendreth the  Wise immediately saw the power and strange geomantic convergence of the site. He insisted a shrine be built immediately, and he brought in shadow-fey guards and mages to embed it with power and bind the ley line.",
								"The small community could not find its way back to Kammae via the river, but with Quendreth's help, they did establish shadow-river connections far and wide, both deep into the Shadow Realm and to the three titanic ley lines to the west, north, and southeast. Sometimes the Black River flowed south, powered the Wandering Crow to the White Road and thus to Revskaya, Raguza, Achillon, and occasionally Harkesh. Other seasons brought connections west and north to Brescia and St. Mischau along the shadow road, and once even to Zobeck. The most difficult connections were those along the Pontoretto, sometimes to Trombei and sometimes as far as Capleon. Charun's faithful used the Black River connection quietly and without fuss, retaining it as a secret of the deeper initiates of the Temple of Charun. And even to those who never traveled the shadow rivers, it knit the community together with a physical embodiment of their faith, though only Quendreth truly seemed to understand how to pilot a vessel to connect the shadow roads, a secret he shared with no others. Or at least with no humans.",
								"With the cult of Charun ensconced in the lower levels of the citadel, trading with inhabitants of the underworld and using the ley line to strengthen its presence from the Seven Cities to the heart of the Dragon Empire, things changed. The arcane power of the Holzangers was passed to the Boatman's followers. Quendreth was suddenly held in high esteem among the congregants who had once made their pilgrimages entirely on the surface world, and he was granted the title of Ferryman within the church. A period of fifteen years kept him at the forefront of Charun's works over a vast territory.",
								"Alas, Quendreth was as susceptible to hubris and arrogance as many of the shadow fey, and he dabbled in Void magic, opening portals to other planes entirely, speaking to demons and devils, and inviting the satarre priestess Miskra ai-Vellec to advise him. This went about as well as you might expect, for even a less zealous priestess such as Miskra was delighted to have such power in her hands\u2014a tool for her own plans\u2014though she also shared much lore with Quendreth, and the two were allies of convenience for a decade. In time though, the satarre Void cultists and the true believers of Charun fell out with each other, but not before Miskra realized she could use the waters of the Black River for certain dark rituals and malign enchantments. In time, the Void cult arrived in force, and Quendreth was forced to leave quickly.",
								"When the shadow-fey wizard departed, he did {@i something} to the ley line that entirely removed its ability to easily connect to the Pontoretto or the shadow road, and its connection to the White Road remained spotty at best. At the same time, Quendreth brought one of the Holzangers back to the Scarlet Citadel\u2014the child of Gerhardt IV\u2014to hold the place and the White Forest in perpetuity (more precisely until their return). He was called Gerhardt the Changeling and had a definite elfmarked look to him. He lived for one hundred years, and at age 70, he took a human wife from Raguza, said to be a pirate captain and certainly a hellraiser. Her name was Melanchia the Reaver, and Gellert the Gruesome is her son."

The toll of the fight would mean the end of their adventuring career, but they returned to this site of their last great battle to retire. They found the giant withered and scavenged to little more than a massive ribcage and decided to build an inn around it, preserving it as their final\u2014and biggest\u2014trophy.",

They are adventurers of a sort (human {@creature scout|MM|scouts}), as most of their family has been, but found they prefer the company of adventurers more than the escapade itself. The family business continues to appeal to adventuring types as evidenced by the monster-hunting trophies on the walls\u2014the stories of which erupt if anyone asks about them\u2014and the very sturdy construction of the tables and chairs.",

If pressed, he admits he went to the arch at the lifeless clearing (see {@area E3|SC-E3|x} in \"{@adventure Beyond Redtower|KPSC|2|Beyond Redtower}\") and spent the night there on a dare; he'd done it a year ago and nothing happened, but this time, he had awful nightmares, and he hasn't slept well since.

The {@creature owlbear|MM} considers the whole courtyard to be its lair, and it attacks anyone who invades its territory, chasing prey up to a quarter mile. It can't scale the crumbly old walls, so characters can escape its claws by climbing.

If they devise ways to turn the Gaoler's traps and torture devices to their own advantage, so much the better. There's also no shame in running away to regroup. Remember that none of these villains kill prisoners outright. The Gaoler and Scar want victims to torture, and Ushulx wants victims for a sacrifice.

The creature who tripped the trap attempts the save normally, but everyone else has disadvantage, and a creature attempts just one saving throw whether it's targeted by one or two bolts. A bolt that one creature dodges can hit another character on the same row of spaces. The sudden movement of trying to dodge the bolts causes bones to clatter down the steps into the room at the bottom. This isn't tremendously loud, but it might be noticed.

Before the corpses animate into {@creature zombie|MM|zombies}, they're just corpses, and damage dealt to them has no effect.

Nothing here spells that out (evil doesn't leave step-by-step instructions for its defeat lying around where anyone can find them).

If characters attack, as they inevitably will, give no indication their attacks are having any effect, because they can't see an effect on something that's invisible. If someone touches it experimentally, describe it as offering some resistance and immediate, searing pain. The longer you keep them guessing about what they're up against, the better.",

Since that could happen days from now or minutes from now, they're in no mood to be delayed by interfering strangers. They aren't equipped to put up a fight, but they call Cagoth-ze for help if they're being prevented from doing their jobs.

Most of this shouldn't involve skill or ability checks, but if your players like that sort of thing, there's no harm in having them make Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) and Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) checks while they examine the construct and letting them believe they're learning more by doing so. Detect magic reveals that much of the device is magical, involving conjuration, transmutation, and time magic (which is rare enough the characters have probably never encountered it before, in which case the spellcaster might not recognize its aura; it's up to you whether you describe the third type as time magic or as a school unknown to the spellcaster).",
