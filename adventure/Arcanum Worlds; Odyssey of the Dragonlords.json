As we designed the campaign, we sought to include ideas from many different sources: {@italic The Odyssey, The Iliad, Jason and the Argonauts, The Oresteia,} and others. However, Thylea is {@bold not} ancient Greece. You will not find Zeus, Athena, or Apollo among the gods.",
						"As you explore Thylea, you will encounter familiar tropes, monsters, and treasures from Greek mythology\u2014but the rules are different here. Mortals have only recently come to these lands. The world of Thylea blends high fantasy with the trappings of ancient history. Elves, dwarves, and halflings now live alongside minotaurs, centaurs, and satyrs.",
						"Our goal is to make your party feel like heroes from one of the greatest stories ever told\u2014but the ultimate end of that story is entirely within your power. Your players will make choices that forever change the world of Thylea. As the gamemaster, we encourage you to embrace this idea and run with it. How will your players reshape history\u2014and what does it mean to be a hero?",

Their ranks included Orpheus, the most talented musician in the world, and Peleus, the father of Achilles. They were even joined by Hercules, the famous warrior, who had recently completed his fabled Twelve Labors.",
						"Why should we liken the heroes of the {@italic Argonautika} to a party of roleplayers? Because in spite of their illustrious qualifications, and in spite of prophecies which foretold success, the Argonauts were ill-equipped for the challenges that awaited them. They abandoned their quest almost as soon as they set sail, and the rest of the story unfolds like a comedy of errors.",
						"Fellow game masters, stop me if this sounds familiar.",
						"Jason of Iolcos bears an uncanny resemblance to your average tabletop roleplayer. When he isn't accidentally slaughtering his own allies, he's wallowing in self-pity and bemoaning his bad luck. He seems just as frightened to lead the party as he is of being usurped. At multiple points in the story, the gods are forced to step in and save the Argonauts from his terrible leadership. In the end, the Golden Fleece is secured through the magic of the sorceress Medea. She isn't even counted among the so-called heroes.",
						"The heroes of Greek mythology are very different from the super-powered, self-sacrificing paragons that we've come to idolize in Hollywood films. In the Greek epics, there is no clear line between good and evil, no villains to thwart, no alien invasions to repel. Heroic deeds are frequently puzzling and at times infuriating. Odysseus punctuates his harrowing journey home by murdering all the men who courted his wife. Achilles refuses to fight when his men need him most. Jason quickly abandons Medea once his quest is finished.",
						"Because of their flaws, it is hard to shake the feeling that the heroes of the Greek epics were real historical figures. When might fails, they succeed through cunning, and when cunning fails, they succeed through luck. These were mortal men cast into impossible situations, forced to survive through spectacular means, and left to brood on the fickle whims of fate. In spite of their divine parentage, they were, above all, very {@italic human}.",
						"This is in large part what makes these characters so enduring in the Western imagination. But most importantly, it makes them the perfect archetypes for the heroes of your next roleplaying campaign.",

They are jealous, capricious, cruel, generous, vengeful, kind, vicious, forgetful, thoughtless, lusty, selfish, passionate, and generally all-too-human in their ways. They do not know everything and cannot control everything, but within their spheres of influence, they are awesome, terrible, and dangerous. It's a foolish mortal who disrespects the gods. The wisest heroes acknowledge the power of the gods over every aspect of life.",
								"Mythic heroes must also contend with the will of mortal kings and queens. Earth-shattering events demand action from the most powerful rulers from across the land, but their hands are often bound by the vagaries of fate.

Oaths have a powerful, far-reaching effect on society. They may create peace between the gods, promote unbreakable fellowships, and even instigate bloody wars.",
								"No mortal of sound mind would ever dare break an oath, lest they be afflicted by terrible curses. To be cursed by the gods is to be cursed by the land itself. Food turns to dust in the mouths of those who are cursed. Harpies peck out their eyes, and their souls are dragged screaming into the Underworld.",

Famous heroes may summon warriors to their aid, influence the opinions of the masses, and even demand audiences with the gods. Though seeking it may shorten one's life, fame is the most direct route to immortality. But the danger of increasing one's fame is hubris.

								"Prophecies reveal paths that would otherwise be hidden to us\u2014paths which allow us to rise to our fate, rather than be destroyed by it. Such paths are often dangerous, and walking them may seem like madness, but that is the task of the mythic hero. To dismiss prophecy and spurn one's fate is hubris of the highest order."

On the other hand, those who turn from fate, break their oaths, and curse the gods will meet tragic endings, even if their lives are happier in the short run.",
								"In other words, mythic heroism means rising to the challenges that fate throws at you, even when the gods themselves work against you. It means losing yourself in the wilderness for decades, only to return in glory when your enemies least expect it. It also means betraying your loved ones, overthrowing rightful kings because of petty grievances, and discovering that you were a pawn of prophecy all along.",

Through harsh winters, blistering summers, and relentless assaults by the native races, the Dragonlords fought tirelessly, and the people of Thylea persevered.",

										"Yet though she was silent, she possessed a powerful resolve that the other Gods sensed and respected. Even Kentimane of the Hundred Hands\u2014the most violent and warlike of them all\u2014was drawn to her quiet strength. She alone of all the Gods could quell his furious temper with her calming spirit.",
										"Eventually, Thylea grew weary of the endless strife and conflicts. She isolated herself from the other Gods, seeking respite on the farthest edges of the ocean. Kentimane\u2014now her lover and protector\u2014followed, turning his back on war and violence to walk with Thylea on the path of tranquility.",
										"Alone, the pair were happy for a time. But Thylea still felt all the pain and suffering in the world like a million arrows piercing her gentle soul. In time, her joy gave way to despair until, unable to bear it any longer, she drowned herself beneath the water.",
										"Yet her death was not a surrender... it was a glorious sacrifice. Thylea's body came apart; her head and torso floating back to the surface to become a chain of virgin islands. Her heart burst from her chest and transformed into a great tree rising up from the center of the continent she had birthed. Her limbs sunk to the bottom of the sea, stretching and twisting into great roots that connected each island, nurturing the fertile plants and gentle animals that sprang into being on the islands' surface.",
										"Kentimane's grief over his lover's death was inconsolable. Without Thylea to temper his moods, he succumbed once more to his most violent urges. Screaming his fury at the heavens, he thrashed and raged in the oceans around the body of his lover, unleashing terrible storms and massive tidal waves that threatened to swallow the new-born islands.",
										"Yet even after her death, a part of Thylea's spirit remained in the great Heart-Tree at the center of the islands. She reached out\u2014silent as ever\u2014and brushed against her mad husband's mind, soothing his tortured spirit with a soft caress. Sensing her presence, the hundred-handed giant transformed his grief into a new purpose. Binding himself to what was left of his lover with a solemn vow, Kentimane became the ward and protector of the islands, taking up an eternal vigil in the waters around their untouched shores.",

A virgin paradise, the Forgotten Land was kept safe from the perils and evils of the outside world by the giant Kentimane of the Hundred Hands\u2014Thylea's lover and protector. And together, the two were content.",
										"But one day, the tree at the center of the islands\u2014the transformed heart of the Mother Goddess herself\u2014blossomed with seven strange fruits. Each the size of a boulder, they shimmered and pulsed with vibrant, shifting colors, almost as if alive. Seeing the tempting bounty sprouting from the branches, Kentimane reached from the ocean and plucked the fruit. His fifty heads gorged themselves on the succulent flesh, tearing and chewing until all that remained were seven spike-covered pits, which he tossed into the ocean.",
										"Instead of sinking, the pits floated on the waves, bobbing up and down. Offended by their taunting presence, Kentimane seized each pit in a clenched fist, squeezing so hard the spikes bit into his flesh and drew blood. Howling in rage, Kentimane slammed the pits down beneath the water, burying them deep beneath the muddy bottom of the ocean floor.",
										"But the next morning the pits floated back up to the surface. Before Kentimane could seize them again, the pits burst open and the children of Thylea and Kentimane sprang forth into existence.",
										"The hundred-handed god stared in wonder at his offspring: eight Titans born from the fruit of Thylea's tree, fertilized by the blood of Kentimane himself. Each of the first six pits had incubated a single child blessed with a different attribute drawn from one of their parents: Strength; Beauty; Wisdom; Craft; Prophecy and Swiftness. As these six Titans grew from children into adults, they became demi-gods, each representing the aspect of their parents they most embodied.",
										"However, from the seventh pit two Titans were born: Sydon and Lutheria, twin brother and sister. Sydon embodied his father's raging fury, and as he grew he became the God of Time and the Lord of Storms. His sister, Lutheria, inherited her mother's stillness and calm... but without Thylea's compassion or gentleness, she would eventually become the Goddess of Death and the Lady of Dreams.",
										"But all this was far in the future, and Kentimane did not foresee what his offspring would one day become. He could not imagine the strife and suffering the Twins would bring to the peaceful islands. If he had known, he might have drowned them on the spot. But instead, he scooped up his children from the waves\u2014including Sydon and Lutheria\u2014and placed them gently at the base of the great Heart-Tree rising up from the center of the island, where Thylea could watch over them.",
										"Having deposited the children in the warm bosom of their mother, Kentimane returned to the sea and resumed his eternal vigil, bound by his sacred vow to keep Thylea\u2014and now also their children\u2014safe from the outside world."

Of all the Titans, only Sydon and Lutheria, his youngest siblings, refused: they were united by the powerful bond, and did not feel the empty loneliness of their kin.",

										"Weakened by his sister's adulation, Talieus did as he was bade and the myrmekes were born. An industrious, insect-like race with a shared hive-mind intelligence, the myrmekes quickly spread out from their isolated home, overwhelming and conquering the native species on nearby islands.",
										"The other Titans condemned Talieus for creating such aggressive and dangerous creatures. Talieus, burning with parental pride, refused act against his newest children. It fell to Sydon, the God of Storms, to halt the myrmekes' advance. As they piled into their ships, he unleashed the fury of the sea, dashing their vessels to smithereens with howling winds, drowning them beneath the waves. Even Sydon could not halt their advance forever. The other Titans, fearful the myrmekes would continue to spread, begged their father for help. Moved by the fears of his children, Kentimane used his hundred hands to gather all the myrmekes onto a single island. Calling on the strength of Thylea herself, he bound them there with powerful magic so they could never leave.",

Then she bound his power to her crystal scythe and forced him to wander eternally in the Nether Sea, dragging her throne-ship across the waves behind him by a great chain strapped around his neck.",

But Sydon had absorbed much of the enslaved Talieus' power, and he easily bested his challenger. Sydon imprisoned the defeated Hergeron beneath a great tower, chaining him to so that the full weight of the building was forever pressing down on Hergeron's enormous neck and shoulders.",
										"The remaining four siblings, realizing Sydon had grown too powerful to challenge directly, decided to strike at Lutheria. In secret, they traveled to her island but the Goddess of Death had set a trap for her kin. Through the ritual sacrifice of a thousand basilisks, she had created a great pool of poisonous blood at the heart of her domain. When the invaders set foot upon the island they triggered wards of power that released the magic of the foul pool in a lethal burst, instantly turning three of them to stone. Only Chalcia, the Goddess of Swiftness, was nimble enough to escape.",
										"Knowing the Twins would come after her, Chalcia took shelter beneath a massive volcano. There she could use her speed and quickness to survive in the labyrinth of tunnels and lava tubes. When Sydon learned of the failed attack against his sister-wife, his fury knew no bounds. In a blind rage, he summoned a great storm to lash all the islands of Thylea, seeking to flood the chambers where Chalcia was hiding.",
										"The storms threatened to wash away Thylea itself, something that Kentimane would not allow. Kentimane had stayed neutral in the battles of his children but, once the safety of all of Thylea became threatened, he was forced to intervene. Kentimane blunted the storms, and he forbade Sydon and Lutheria from destroying the volcano that sheltered their fugitive sister. Sydon was loathe to let Chalcia escape retribution, but even he was not strong enough to defy his mighty father. Lutheria, cunning as ever, knew of another way to get revenge.",
										"Uniting their power, and the power stolen from their fallen siblings, the Twins reached deep into the foundation of Thylea. They shifted rock and stone, careful not to disturb the islands above as they sealed off the tunnels and chambers beneath the volcano one by one.",
										"Chalcia ran from their relentless work, driven ever deeper beneath the earth. In the end, the elusive Goddess of Swiftness found herself trapped in a tiny chamber at the very heart of the volcano itself. With every exit sealed, the walls slowly closed in tighter and tighter as burning lava oozed through cracks and crevices in floor and ceiling. Instead of crushing her, the Twins stopped at the last instant, entombing their sister for all eternity in a crypt of searing heat and noxious fumes."

										"But the remote continent birthed from their mother could not remain hidden forever. As the centuries passed, the so-called civilized races, humans, elves, dwarves and their like, began to stumble across the islands at the far reaches of the Forgotten Sea. The first to arrive were refugees and castaways, survivors of ships gone astray. Half-drowned, they crawled onto island shores and carved out a meager existence among the native fey races.",

When others came, the explorers and settlers, she stayed Sydon's fury and allowed them to land safely so she could study these strange folk. As their numbers grew, the civilized races established small villages along the coasts. Bit by bit, they spread across the islands of Thylea, until their numbers brought them into conflict with the original inhabitants.",

They lacked the power to resist the magic tricks and temptations of the nymphs, dryads and satyrs.

Joining them were Adonis Neurdagon, beautiful and vain; the brothers Telamok and Estor Arkelandor, ruthless and savage warriors; and several others who have since been forgotten. Each warrior was oathsworn to a dragon, and together, they were nigh unstoppable in battle.",

At his sister's urging, Sydon ignored the pleading of his worshippers to cleanse Thylea of the invaders. Under the leadership of the Dragonlords, the civilized races entered an age of unprecedented expansion.",

He had no desire to rule or govern, and his only joy was battle. Most, including his dragon, thought he was a brave hero, seeking glory. The truth was far worse, for war was the only way that Estor could satisfy his bloodlust and cruelty. His victories on the battlefield meant nothing beyond the chance of slaughter and carnage.",

In Telamok's mind, his brother would break the gygan ranks and force the giants to bend the knee. Estor, however, had other plans.",

Once they knew the battle was lost, they threw down their weapons in surrender. Estor refused to take prisoners, and refused to parley. To the horror of his noble dragon mount, he ordered his troops to massacre every single gygan warrior.",

Estor's dragon begged him to show mercy, but he was deaf to her pleas. His army massacred mothers and children, the old and the infirm. Only a handful of gygans escaped to warn the other fey folk of Estor's atrocities.",

The crew of the {@italic Ultros} ravaged the islands of Thylea, leaving slaughter in their wake. Sydon threw everything against the vessel, trying to smash it with hundred-foot waves or drag it down to the bottom of the sea. The magic of the {@italic Ultros} was so powerful even the God of Storms couldn't sink it.",
										"With Sydon's failure, it fell to Lutheria to find a way to end Estor's reign of terror. She approached the barbaric Captain in a dream: if Estor swore to end his massacres against her children, she would give him and his crew eternal life by ritual magic. Estor was naturally wary of a trap, particularly when approached by a naked goddess in his dreams, but he knew that he was safe on the Ultros. Even the Goddess of Death could not harm him. Seduced by the Goddess, he woke from his dream and slit the throats of his officers as a blood sacrifice to begin her immortality ritual.",

The Captain, as Estor now styled himself, was enchanted by her cold, cruel beauty and lay with the Goddess to consummate the arrangement. The two were surrounded by the leering corpses of his butchered men.",

Though all knew how Estor had betrayed them, Lutheria's ritual bound them to his will. When they saluted their Captain, Estor let out a great, roaring laugh. He knew he had been blessed by Lutheria and would never die.",

Estor and his crew could not die, but they still felt pain: wounds would not kill them, but neither would they heal. Instead, they festered and rotted. Age could not touch them, but they felt the ravages of disease and illness. Lutheria was true to her word: as the years turned to decades and then centuries, they did not die. They endured as twisted and disfigured creatures, trapped in a world between life and death as they were slowly driven mad.",

										"Balmytria saw that unless the Titans were stopped, they would destroy all of Thylea. She vowed action.",
										"Knowing that Sydon and Lutheria were proud creatures, Balmytria challenged the Twins to the game of twenty squares, which is also called the Royal Game. She summoned them to the island of the Golden Heart, which is the home of the Mother Goddess herself. They would play beneath the great tree, with the mother of the Titans as their sacred witness.",
										"The stakes would be simple: she would wager her life and the lives of all her kind against the divine power of the Titans. In this way, the war could be ended.",
										"Lutheria saw the trap right away, but her husband would not listen. Sydon had never been defeated at the Royal Game in all his centuries. He accepted Balmytria's terms, and the game began.",
										"When gods play the game of twenty squares, the pieces symbolize entire armies, and the fall of the dice are like the hammers of Fate, drenching the earth with the blood of those armies. Thousands of soldiers may live and die by the turn of a single gambit.",
										"Balmytria knew that Sydon had never lost at the Royal Game. Accordingly, she chose her moves with extreme care, taking the full time allotted\u2014one rotation of the stars per turn. And all the while, she was maddeningly silent. Sydon shouted at her, demanding that she look him in the eyes, rise to his taunts, or just say anything at all. He quickly lost patience with the game, rolling the dice as soon as his turns began, simply to have it over with. His impatience proved his undoing.",
										"Balmytria won the first game, shattering the Titan's winning record and his pride. He raised his fists to the sky and mountains crumbled, so angry was he. But before his sister-wife could calm him, he had doubled the stakes and challenged the silver dragon to a rematch.",
										"This continued for five more games. Balmytria remained patient, neither speaking nor eating even as a full month passed. Meanwhile, Sydon spiralled into a wrath such as the world had never seen.",
										"Lutheria clawed at her own face, furious with her husband's idiocy. She could not interfere with the game directly, for the magic that enforces the game of twenty squares is woven deep into the fabric of the multiverse.",
										"But she knew that the seventh game was sacred. \"Seventh game takes all,\" they say. If Sydon could win the seventh game, then the six previous matches would mean nothing. The Titans would have their way.",
										"As her husband lost game after game, Lutheria sat quietly, weaving magic into the dice. Even the greatest spells in Thylea seemed to have no effect. Desperate, she began to pour her divine power into the dice. As the magical energy took hold of the dice, she felt herself growing weaker\u2014and Sydon began to win. No matter how carelessly he threw the dice, they delivered victory. And as the final game drew to a close, it was clear that Balmytria was about to lose eveything.",
										"Laughing, arrogant, triumphant, the Twin Titans threw open their mouths and shouted in the face of the silver dragon, \"You are nothing. {@italic You are nothing.}\"",
										"But Balmytria only smiled. \"I have staked my life on this game, and you have staked your divine power. You gave your divine power to win this game, but now I give my life to match your sacrifice.\" With this, she plunged a dagger into her chest, and her blood spilled across the twenty squares, soaking the enchanted dice.",
										"When Balmytria's blood mixed with the magic of the dice, the fate of the world was forever altered.",
										"Balmytria knew the dragons could not defeat the immortal Titans unless they became immortals themselves. That was her plan all along. She never intended to kill Sydon and Lutheria, for she knew that the Fates were working against her. Instead, she sought to steal the divine power of the Titans for her own blood.",
										"As Balmytria's blood drained from her body, the Titans' divine power replaced it. She ascended into the heavens as Mytros, the Goddess of Dawn. Her husband became Volkan, the God of the Forge. Her children became Vallus, the Goddess of Wisdom; Pythor, the God of Battle; Narsus, the God of Beauty; and Kyrah, the Goddess of Music. Together, this new pantheon would turn the tide of the war completely.",
										"History says the dragons are gone, but that is not entirely true. The dragons are still here, but they have been changed into something even greater. Mytros won the war that could not be won by sacrificing herself and ensuring a future for all the mortals of Thylea."

Eventually, the centaur armies were broken, and the gygan armies were all but exterminated. Sydon and Lutheria had very little left with which they could fight\u2014but they were still gods.",
										"Lutheria lay claim to the vast underworld of the Nether Sea, capturing the souls of the dead to make up for what she had lost. Sydon secured his hold on the waters of Thylea, generating great storms that battered the mortal cities into submission. In this way, they forced a stalemate in the war, with the hope that they might recover from their losses.",

They hunted down and slaughtered most of the remaining Dragonlords, including Estor Arkelander, the captain of the {@italic Ultros}. The true fate of these brave warriors is largely unrecorded in the histories. In the end, both sides of the war were threatened with total annihilation.",
										"Finally exhausted, the Titans and the Five Gods met once more beneath the great tree of the Golden Heart. They cut their hands and made blood handshakes, agreeing to a solemn truce for five hundred years. This agreement became known as the Oath of Peace, and Mytros, the Goddess of Dawn, sealed the oath with most of her remaining power.",

										"The children of the Dragonlords became kings, and their dynasties ruled over new cities that sprang up across the land.

In spite of this, many of his greatest works have been scattered across Thylea, and some have even fallen into the hands of his enemies.",

He may be gruff and silent for long stretches, only to suddenly appear with some miracle device or solution. He delights in creation, rather than destruction, and he is always intrigued by an intricate new device or stratagem.",

He'll never admit it, but centuries of failure and personal tragedy have taken their toll on his fighting spirit. He believes his glory days are behind him, and he seeks to drown this fact in a river of wine."

				"As one of the Five Gods, Kyrah is revered as the trickster of music and poetry. There are very few shrines to her, but bards and poets call upon her for inspiration as \"the Muse.\" She is the swiftest of all the gods, both in thought and deed. She is capable of disappearing in the blink of an eye, and she can travel great distances with mere steps. Her mind is equally swift. Her voice is said to be more beautiful than any instrument.",
				"Kyrah regularly travels through the Heartlands in the guise of an adventurous bard. She carries dozens of scroll-cases with her, most of which contain terrible poems of her own composition. She can write good ones, but she prefers the bad ones, because she is so amused by people's reactions to them. No matter how harsh the critique, she never holds grudges against critics. She serves as the court poet to the Queen of Mytros, her sister Vallus. Vallus finds Kyrah annoying, and she finds any excuse to send her away on errands.",
				"Kyrah wishes above all else to write a great epic poem, something that would make even the Mother Goddess herself laugh and weep. In her search for new material, she is attracted to heroes who perform great deeds, as well as those who are fated to meet terrible ends. She is flirty, witty, clever, and attractive, but for reasons that she never makes clear, will never consent to marry anyone who cannot beat her in a foot race.",
				"Kyrah came to Thylea as a young bronze dragon. She served as the mount for the infamous Dragonlord Estor Arkelander. She is still weighed down by shame for the atrocities that Estor committed while the two of them were oathsworn. Kyrah cannot transform back into her dragon form until the Oath of Peace ends.",
				"Kyrah seeks to atone for the sins of Estor Arkelander by doing as much good as possible. She is full of optimistic energy, and she refuses to stand by when even the slightest injustices go uncorrected and unpunished. Kyrah detests sitting still, and her eagerness for a good story makes her a bit reckless. She will sometimes goad mortals into dangerous acts of heroism, hoping for dramatic material that she can use.",
				"However, she never acts maliciously, and she is careful to study prophecies; she doesn't make unreasonable demands. Kyrah loves to play tricks, large and small. Consequently, few people worship her, but nearly everyone believes in her. She is often \"credited\" when things go missing, or when objects suddenly reappear without explanation. She is especially fond of playing pranks on humorless tyrants and petty bullies, such as King Acastus of Mytros."

				"Vallus is revered as the goddess of wisdom. She was once known to travel far and wide, surveying ancient ruins and collecting lore concerning the origins of the land and the fey races. Prayers are offered to Vallus when guidance is needed and information is scarce, and she is believed to know as much about Thylea's history as Sydon and Lutheria. She is the oldest daughter of Mytros and, in many ways, she has inherited her mother's place as patron goddess to the city that bears her name.",
				"Vallus works closely with the priests of Mytros to encourage faith in the Five, even as mortals everywhere fall prey to fear of Sydon and Lutheria. She remains a pillar of strength holding the city together as things are beginning to fall apart elsewhere. However, in spite of her best efforts, the citizens of Mytros increasingly offer prayers and sacrifices to the treacherous Titans. Vallus accepts this with grace and humility, and in spite of her declining power, she will do anything to defend her city.",
				"Vallus has a reputation for conspicuous vanity. She never allows herself to be seen without exquisite, queenly regalia, and she habitually examines her own reflection in a silver hand mirror. This is partly because she understands the importance of appearances in the world of mortal politics\u2014but she is also vain.",
				"Vallus is extraordinarily perceptive, often to the point where she is suspected of mindreading. She always seems to discern truth, even when she is told a clever lie. A hard stare from Vallus is often enough to make even the most skilled liars concede the truth. Vallus has lost much of her faith in the future of Thylea. Although she endeavors to protect the Temple of the Five in Mytros, she has witnessed too much of Thylean history to believe that the Oracle's prophecy will result in anything but total disaster.",
				"Vallus has one regret: her marriage to King Acastus. Over the centuries, she has been intimate with many beautiful mortals who captured her heart, but her union with Acastus in 478 CE was entirely political. The two have grown to hate each over the years, not least because Acastus makes a point of treating his many infidelities as sport. They have no children, although Acastus probably has many unacknowledged bastards.",
				"Vallus's true form is a young bronze dragon, who previously served as a mount for Telamok Arkelander. While Telamok was responsible for almost as many atrocities as his brother Estor, Vallus understands this was part of the cost of settling in Thylea. She is not wracked with the same second-hand guilt that plagues Kyrah."
