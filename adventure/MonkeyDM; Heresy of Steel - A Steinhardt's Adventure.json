Originally a humble manikin crafted by the Scions, Malach has evolved into a malevolent being, driven by both a hatred for humans and a twisted sympathy for his fellow constructs. His haunting yet captivating appearance is adorned with a skin woven from his victims, and his wings display hands and faces\u2014ghastly trophies of lives he has extinguished\u2014 transforming him into the Angel of Flesh.",

Operating in clandestine locations, he experiments to fuse manikins with eldritch substances to create a formidable force. His ultimate scheme is to pit the Radiant Church against the Scions, exacerbating the existing fractures between the factions.",

He dispatched manikins, marked with the Scions' emblems, to steal this cargo, further fomenting conflict between the Scions and the Radiant Church. However, Malach remains unaware that the Forsaken have similar designs on the cargo, setting the stage for an explosive confrontation.",

The characters are thrust into a web of conspiracy and must navigate a city teetering on a precipice of dread, endeavoring to dismantle the core of Malach's sinister plot\u2014a plot with the potential to engulf Luyarnha in darkness forever."

								"Bathed in the gloom of a fog-choked night, the Chancery Lane Bazaar stretches across cobblestone streets, each lined with vendor stalls shrouded in tattered canvas canopies. A multitude of creaking signs swing in the cold wind, advertising everything from meats and clothing to tools and weapons. Shopkeepers, draped in thick woolen cloaks and obscured by the mist, hawk their wares in hushed tones, eyes flickering nervously toward the shadows. The air is thick with the scent of incense fighting back an undertone of sewage. Patrons clad in all manners of garb, from the opulent to the ragged, hurry from stall to stall, clutching their belongings tightly. Gas lamps gutter in iron sconces, casting muted glows that barely pierce the enveloping darkness. An unsettling melody from an unseen hurdy-gurdy fills the air, oddly echoing as though defying the laws of sound and space.",
								"At the far end of the square, Rodric the Alchemist sells alcohol and \"healing\" elixirs of questionable origin, his eyes constantly darting about as if expecting trouble. His brews and tinctures are potent, but their ingredients are dubious at best. Nearby, Meadda the Weaver offers intricately embroidered garments and homespun talismans that promise protection against supernatural forces, her silvery hair meticulously braided with crimson-thorn vines.",
								"The notorious Black Blade Arms stall attracts a crowd with its array of unique weaponry; its proprietor, Gregor the Bonegrinder, has a reputation as a ruthless mercenary said to possess a sword that can sever a person's soul. Near the market's center is a mysterious tent, shrouded in darkness, where visitors report hearing discordant melodies. Rumor has it that the tent is a gathering spot for a cult that seeks to commune with supernatural forces to fight the waves of scourge beasts.",

This shadow, devoid of a source, beckons me toward the unknown, navigating the blurred lines between reality and the obscured world that exists just beyond our perception.

There's an undeniable pull towards the scourge, a rhythmic pulsing in my veins that syncs with the waves beneath the crimson moonlight. This connection, whatever it is, is reshaping me. My personal mission is clear: to confront the sinister forces that lurk in Luyarnha, using the curse bestowed upon me as a weapon for the city's deliverance. Yet, I'm wary; the allure of darkness is potent. The choices I face could either liberate Luyarnha or spell my own destruction. What does this bond with the scourge mean, and how will it change me?"
