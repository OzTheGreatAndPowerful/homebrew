To enhance the tone of this dark fantasy setting, the following revised rest rules are implemented throughout the adventure. By incorporating these changes, the campaign aims to create a sense of urgency and danger, reinforcing the idea that the characters are constantly facing grave threats. The revised rest rules are designed to make the players carefully consider their actions and resources, as recovery becomes a more precious and difficult process in this unforgiving world.",

This resource also contains helpful rules for running combat encounters more efficiently, writing compelling villains, and more.",

Will they rise to the challenge and turn the tide against the darkness, or will they fall victim to the city’s impending doom?"
