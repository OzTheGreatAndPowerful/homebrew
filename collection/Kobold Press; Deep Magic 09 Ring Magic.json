						"Dwarves are renowned shapers of the physical world. Earth, stone, and even metal bend to the will of dwarven hammers. It’s easy to assume that because dwarves have such tremendous skill at shaping material, they must lack the time and interest to become masters of the arcane, too—but that assumption is dead wrong. Taking unformed matter and shaping it minutely to conform to one’s will is the perfect arena for blending the physical and arcane arts. The dwarves’ greatest magic has been bound to this arena, as evidenced by the legendary weapons, armor, and implements of war that emerge from their mountain stronghold forges. Comparatively few dwarves pursue the study of magic outside the act of creation or of devotion to their deities, but one discipline bridges the gap between creation and spellcasting: ring magic.",
						"Ring magic is the dwarven art of forging metal into rings, usually with powerful runes inscribed on their surface, and using those rings to shape magic. Practitioners channel their magic through specially prepared rings, increasing the devastation wreaked upon their foes, and they can even imbue spells into a ring that someone else can unleash later.",
						"Rings created for this purpose are more than decorative jewelry. They more often take the form of precious-metal rings large enough to adorn a weapon, a staff, or a suit of armor. Wizards who devote themselves to ring magic are rare outside dwarf lands, but they’re instantly recognizable by the ring-adorned staves they carry.",

										"The ring is a strange shape to the dwarven mindset, which is firmly rooted in the angles and planes they see constantly in the mineral formations around their underground homes. Dwarf architecture is filled with corners, precise angles, saw-toothed runes, patterns of regular and irregular polygons, adornments of gold laid out in precise geometric forms, and stacked blocks or slabs. These aren’t just cultural fashions; such shapes reflect how dwarves think and how they prefer to see the world. Curves are seldom seen, and a circle—devoid of angles and planes, with no beginning and no end—is a foreign shape that denies boundaries and evokes eternity. It is a construct of the mind and spirit but not the chisel; it evokes the sun and moon, raindrops, flowers, and the cycle of the seasons—things that are seen on the surface world but have no place in the hard, subterranean realm of the dwarves. Dwarves make sense of this alien concept by shaping metal into its likeness. Once they can hold this ephemeral concept in their calloused hands, feel its weight and heft, they can better understand.",
										"Yet because it has no beginning and no end, because of its powerful symbolic ties to life, the ring is uniquely suited to be a receptacle for magic.",
										"The first practitioners of ring magic gleaned the secrets from visions granted by their gods. The seeds of ring magic were subtle, woven in dreamlike metaphor that was lost on many but needed the dwarves’ mastery of craftsmanship to reach fruition. For generations, it was practiced in such isolation that no one recognized ring magic as a growing craft. Over time the dwarves realized that within their longheld techniques, the ore of another secret awaited excavation. These enlightened dwarves retreated deep under the mountains, to a place where molten rock flowed freely. There they carved great halls and forges fueled by the earth’s fire. They worked tirelessly in their delve to perfect their new art, and their efforts were rewarded.",
										"Runes and sigils decorate every inch of this legendary stronghold’s walls, revealing the secrets of ring magic and its signature spells to those who can read them. Ring wardens understand these writings as well as if they were their own spellbooks. In fact, a gathering of wizards at the walls, preparing their spells to the sound of ringing hammers, is a common scene. But this is a secretive community. The number of outsiders who have seen the halls of the ring wardens can be counted on one hand, and those few are bound to secrecy by oaths sworn on adamantine rings they can never remove. The molten fire forges still ring under dwarven hammers to this day. While it isn’t a requirement to study here for a wizard to become a ring warden, it is a pilgrimage all dwarf ring wardens make at least once."
