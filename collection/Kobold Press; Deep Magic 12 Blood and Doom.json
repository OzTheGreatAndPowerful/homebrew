						"Blood and Doom deals with antipaladins and blood magic. Antipaladins, blood mages, and wielders of blood magic in general are intended to appear only as nonplayer characters. That's not because antipaladin or blood mage player characters are unbalanced or no fun. They can be great fun for the person who's playing them, but either of these characters in a group of mostly Good or Neutral PCs can be a real problem for everyone else. Evil characters in general, and antipaladins and blood mages in particular, are more than the sum of a few distasteful class abilities. Both represent an approach to life and society that's utterly amoral, self-centered, and uncompromising—a bad combination where party harmony is concerned.",
						"Before even thinking about making up a character that uses the spells and abilities in this chapter of {@i Deep Magic}, you must clear it not only with your GM but also with the other players. Make sure everyone understands what they're allowing into the group and that they're willing to put up with the consequences.",

								"It's no secret that the world is not as it should be. Anyone who looks at it honestly must admit that. Where people disagree is how it can be set right. Those who believe it can be done with open expression, cooperation, and understanding are fools. It will take strife, suffering, and buckets of blood to set it right. A field produces no crops until the farmer slices it open with a blade. So, too, will the wrongness in the world refuse to yield until a blade cuts across its face.",
								"Few people have the strength of body or mind to do what must be done, and too many view the necessary measures as acts of evil. Is it evil to cut diseased flesh away from a body that's struggling to survive? Is it evil to bring a cat into your home to kill the mice that make nests in your mattress, eat tallow candles, and befoul stored food with their waste? The mouse might well say so, as it's being devoured by the cat. But the mouse is wrong; it's grisly death is both necessary and right. The truly wise know that what's right and what's popularly called \"good\" are often not the same thing.",
								"This crucial work takes time, however—more time than mortals have. Only someone who has conquered death can carry this standard, and only the paladin who has sworn the oath of the {@class Paladin|PHB|Giving Grave|Giving Grave|DM12}—an antipaladin—is equal to the task.",

Eventually, a simple cut from a broken alembic—the result of a moment's clumsiness during an arcane experiment—caused him to bleed to death.",
