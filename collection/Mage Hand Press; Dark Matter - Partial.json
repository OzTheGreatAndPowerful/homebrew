				"This new skill in Dark Matter governs how well one can manipulate a technological interface and gain access to information or other functions. Your Intelligence (Data) check encompasses your knowledge of software and its exploits, more than hardware (which is covered by the Technology skill), and so will only be used when you use technology that has an interface, like a datapad, an arcane terminal, a ship's computer, or other control technology, like a door control or the computers that govern a {@item shield generator|darkmatter} or ship weapon. If a piece of technology doesn't have an interface, an interface rig is required to interact with it. The GM should call for an Intelligence (Data) check whenever you attempt complicated operations on a data system, when you attempt to reprogram a construct, or when you attempt to hack a device.",
				"Any sort of illegal or unauthorized access to a technological system is called Hacking and requires the use of an {@item interface rig|darkmatter}, as well as an Intelligence (Data) check. In general, a hacking attempt requires 1 minute of work using the technology, though the GM can decide that certain tasks might take only an action. On a successful check to hack a device, you can perform operations on the system as if you had full access. On a failed check, roll a d6. On a 6, the device locks down and no further attempts can be made to hack it. More secure devices might lock on a roll of 5 or 6, or on a roll of 4 to 6, as determined by the GM. You can hack into devices to illegally access a security system, open a door, disable an alarm, or manipulate someone else's datapad to give you access to their information or bank account."

			"Piloting": [
				"A new skill in Dark Matter, your Dexterity (Piloting) check covers how well you maintain control over a ship in difficult circumstances. You don't need proficiency in Piloting to fly a ship (be it an aircraft or a spacecraft), but proficiency in this skill can help when you need to make a crash landing or pull off a risky maneuver in a dogfight. The GM might call for a Dexterity (Piloting) check when you attempt to fly a ship through an electromagnetic storm that disrupts the controls, or when you wish to perform a hard stop or pull a high-G turn."
			],
			"Technology": [
				"Your Intelligence (Technology) check measures your ability to understand the inner workings of technological devices. Most devices are powered by some form of magic, but plenty of intricate design goes into channeling that magic into useful effects. Use this skill to understand unfamiliar or complex technology or to modify or repair devices. The GM may call for an Intelligence (Technology) check when you attempt to modify a blaster, repair your ship's {@item shield generator|darkmatter}, disable a rogue android, or sabotage an arcane terminal."

					"Sometimes seen as a fate worse than death, exile has long been a popular sanction for radicals, dissidents, and troublemakers.

Many a coup or revolution has resulted in the leaders and courtiers of the old regime being consigned to exile, sometimes on a moon or neighboring planet, sometimes on the other side of the ‘verse.",

An exile has a unique opportunity to absorb foreign cultures and contact émigré communities while rallying support remotely. Living in exile might provide benefits that aren't available back home, such as the freedom to pursue otherwise forbidden love interests or take advantage of more lenient tax policies, either of which could deliver the impetus to accept a self-imposed exile.",

For some, their exile was only temporary, and now they seek to embark on a dangerous journey home, while others might seek to foment rebellion in absentia so as to be welcomed as liberating heroes on their return. Some exiles are gripped by wanderlust, traveling the world with a small group of companions. The unluckiest of all, however, might find themselves unwelcome everywhere, with no choice other than to continue wandering forever."

The link is inherently frail; removing the pilot incorrectly or critically damaging the ship invariably results in a ship-wide detonation.",

On the inside, the chitinous black exoskeletons give way to tough, crimson tissue that lines the walls and hallways. Structures of black chitin form biomechanical interfaces, devices, rooms, and hallways. A stygian ship can nearly pilot itself, but is driven by psionic impulse from wrothian primarchs, who reside near the ship's nervous center.",

Deep in the Black, the wroth inhabit their stygian ships, emerging only to raid planets for humanoids, harvesting them for their bio-matter and minds. These minds are processed into brains in a jar, whose psionic potential nourishes the ships and the wrothians themselves, perpetuating the cycle."

									"The following ships are evidence of convergent design in action: whereas flying cars, freighters, and space stations are constructed by engineers of every race, the most efficient designs transcend industrial trends favored by different empires. Though an elven flying car might be made of sleek ironwood and a dwarven one would feature hard angles and a more spacious trunk, they're both more alike than they are different, and consequently share the same statistics.",
									"Pragmatic but inefficient designs also belong in this category. The Battle Planetoid, for example, is an asteroid or small moon retrofitted with engines, {@item life support|darkmatter}, and a small Dark Matter engine. Though utterly impractical, goblins, kobolds, and other small races have utilized this design time and again.",
									"The exception to this rule is a ship that literally belongs nowhere else: {@vehicle The Infinity|darkmatter} is a legendary vessel, made by no race living today. Endlessly cycling the galaxy, this ship crosses its breadth each day on an unpredictable course, falling out of void jumps just long enough to charge up the next one. Glimpsing it between jumps is a one in a billion occasion. No one knows who designed the ship and set it on its lonely orbit, and to date, no one has been able to approach and board the ship before it once again jumps. It is an enigma; perhaps a relic of an ancient galactic empire, a visitor from another galaxy, or something even stranger."
