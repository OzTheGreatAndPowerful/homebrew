The shuttle has room for 9 Medium creatures (a pilot and eight passengers) and can carry up to 2,000 pounds of cargo. The shuttle is enclosed and contains clean, breathable air. It can fly at a speed of 100 feet per round, or up to 1,500 feet per round in a vacuum. The shuttle can carry its passengers into space by flying vertically for 5 minutes on most planets and can enter a planet's atmosphere by descending for the same amount of time. The shuttle has life support and sensors, and is designed to dock with larger ships in the same way a fighter-sized ship can.<br>The shuttle has AC 10 and 8 mega hit points. The spell ends if the shuttle drops to 0 hit points. When the spell ends, the shuttle gently descends to the ground (if there is a substantial planetoid nearby), giving the passengers time to exit."

In the heat, the seed swells to an incredible size and, through completely unknown mechanisms, metamorphoses into a young gigapod. Once it is large enough, the gigapod hatches from the planetoid, smashing it like an egg.",

Most scholars believe this to be the most likely scenario, but the other possibilities are just as likely and far more terrifying.",

													"Clearly, the tripods are designed with alien and hostile intent, but beyond that, they are an enigma. Atop their three flexible legs\u2014nearly 40 feet high\u2014rests a domed chassis and menacing central eye, bright as a spotlight. This light is merely a precursor to the tripod's mounted laser cannon, which can reduce a man to ash in mere seconds. If an enemy wanders too close, the tripod can also produce a number of long tendrils to ensnare and capture its victim.",
													"Within, their mechanics are incomprehensible\u2014they have no guiding system remotely like a construct core; instead, every surface is covered with a thick layer of their red moss. Should the moss be critically poisoned, or the tripod be unable to refresh it with enough water, the tripod falls into a perpetually dormant state, to be awoken only by some later threat. By that strange metric, it seems almost reasonable to state that the moss is in fact controlling the tripods, if such a thing is truly possible.",
													"Each tripod is capable of manufacturing more of its kind, producing them at a rate of about one tripod every seven days, provided it can find sufficient materials. After landing, a small number of tripods can quickly swell to an invading army of terrible power. However, tripods only seem to replicate once they have cleared enough room for the red moss to proliferate far ahead of them, and only pause to replicate if they have encountered stern resistance."

It drinks deep of whatever water it encounters, spreading rapidly up riverbanks and along coastlines, choking other plants and vegetation with its roots. A single clump of red moss can transform a rainforest into a crimson jungle in a matter of hours.",
													"As it spreads, the moss progressively alters the soil and atmosphere to favor its conditions for growth. It ejects sulfuric compounds into the air, soil, and water, inducing global changes with alarming speed. This terraforming is the final step for a tripod invasion. Once a planet has fully given way to its new atmosphere, a few tripods leave, flying aimlessly in search of new worlds, while the rest fall dormant, keeping a silent vigil over their conquered planet."
