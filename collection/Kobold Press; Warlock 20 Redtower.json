						"Some dungeons are dug out with precision by massive hordes of undead workers or tribes of goblins, built in great chaos and energy to the plan of some cunning mind. The Scarlet Citadel is more of a peculiar growth of layer upon layer of tunnels, defensive halls, hidden crypts and labs, and many secrets buried deep below the surface.",
						"Human settlement of the White Forest started very modestly indeed at the nearby river village of Redtower. However, over time, both the village and the castle deeper in the woods became a site of importance to dungeoneers, arcane seekers, geomancers, and a certain breed of dwarven mystic. Read on and know the truth of its founding, its blood-soaked history, and its current odd decay.",

								"The castle now called the Scarlet Citadel sits on the site of an ancient elven hunting lodge in the White Forest, claimed by a noble family after the Great Retreat 400-some years ago. The land was thus owned by House von Holzanger who owed fealty at various times to Illyria, to the Republic of Triolo, to the Canton of Melana, and (most often) to the Magdar Kingdom. Always rather deft in politics and inclined to an unambitious policy of, \"Just leave us alone with our books and hawks and hunting,\" House von Holzanger might have remained a footnote if it were not for their control of the Scarlet Crow ley line and their willingness to annoy the fey lords and ladies of the forest.",
								"Originally, the pretty lodge was visited each summer and fall for boar hunts, chasing deer in the White Forest, and fish-hawking along the Templine riverbanks. The family realized that the road to the lodge could also be utilized for timber transport, so the lodge became the manor for a new lumber village along the river. The lodge itself remained a place of blissful seclusion, though with some ability to gather servitors, various goods, and skilled craftsman from the village.",
								"This village was named Redleaf. At first, they sold their finest oak, ash, and rowan either east to the city Melana or north to the Magdar merchants for barrels, barge masts, and much else. The trade was not without problems (the forest fey included some alseid and bothersome druids), but in all, it was a worthwhile little fiefdom for the Holzangers. Over time, the village grew, and then Gerhardt von Holzanger came along, the first of the Holzanger sorcerers."

								"About 250 years ago, the young von Holzanger discovered a rich ley line tributary nearby, connecting easily to the White Road to the south and (with only modest arcane rituals) also to the shadow road to the northwest and even (with rather more strenuous and blood-soaked rituals) to the ancient Pontoretto ley line of Valera and its elven lords. The ley line itself seemed to pool and gather strength near the hunting lodge more than the village itself, and the isolated lodge was a good place for experiments that often involved chanting, arcane lights, and the strange smells of alchemical enhancements and distillations.",
								"Gerhardt kept his secret for almost 10 years until he took an apprentice who later ran away to Schio and told his tale. A ley line that might connect other ley lines! Ley line philters and encasements that reacted to void power, to radiant magic, and to shadow! Ley line distillations that gave his cruel master much added strength of body and mind! The tales were wild and had the effect that the apprentice Waldmer intended\u2014the privacy of the White Forest Lodge was a thing of the past.",
								"With the wider understanding of the discovery, the area was suddenly of interest to geomancers, the shadow fey, and darker forces who wished to travel the fey roads between the three lines, to plumb the mysteries of why this backwater might connect ley lines in this way and how this strong ley line might be harnessed. The first few visitors were greeted politely and told to go away. Later visitors were treated as foes. Over the years, the hunting lodge\u2014at the ley line's strongest point\u2014was rebuilt with the red stone common to the area, first as a single tower and then as a small keep.",
								"Arcane secrets were under frequent investigation. Gerhardt von Holzanger grew rich taking on various comely, cunning, and willing apprentices (some believe {@book Arshin the Enchanter|W02DM|3}\u2014see {@loader Warlock #2|collection/Kobold Press; Warlock 02 Dread Magic.json}\u2014was one of them, more long-lived than most) and having built his redstone castle on the site of the ley line's greatest resonance and generally making the most of it. He bound himself to the ley line, giving himself and his children greater strength in using its magic but also making it difficult to wander far from the Wandering Crow. At first, he could travel as far as Zigistad, Melana, and Triolo itself, but over time, this narrowed to Peltzenheim and the town of Erdovar (before its ruin) and Schio. Some believe this same ritual binds the master of Demon Mountain to his own domicile, granting him great power in a highly limited space."

								"Despite the lack of travel, Gerhardt's private ley line offered strength and the seemingly boundless ability to study, learn, and tinker, delighting first Gerhardt and then his progeny (his wife was one Edelfrieda the Golden, said to be a druid, a sorceress, or an elfmarked petty noble of Dornig\u2014some insist on all three). Within the reach of the White Forest, first Gerhardt the Elder and then Gerhardt the Younger and then Gertruda and Gunthar and Gerhardt III all had control over the ley lines, countering any foe or assassin skillfully, inventing new ways to charm a friend or turn an enemy into a bug. Over generations, their interests delved deep into newts and amphibians and then the family was obsessed with horology and celestial mechanics and then with flotation and levitation and then with night creatures and then angelic languages and on and on. Always seeking knowledge purely to possess it, rarely using it to better their small barony or even to enrich themselves or their peasantry.",
								"For a fairly brief period, the area was quasi-independent, and each von Holzanger sorcerer styled himself the \"Baron of Citarossa, Lord of the White Forest, and Master of the Scarlet Citadel.\" So it went for nigh 200 years: always a tiny power, always independent, though sometimes paying tribute to one power or another, and always a strange little oddity known mostly to merchants, timberfolk, and the southern Magdar towns.",
								"However, their overweening pride and their power drew attention, and in time, an unexpected arrival ended the first age of the citadel roughly 150 years ago."

								"The dwarves of the cantons and of the city-state of Melana are makers, forgers of steel, imbuing weapons with the power of Mavros and Svarog\u2014and even Ninkash and Rava\u2014and durable armor, enchanted barrels, and wondrous works in gold, steel, and stone. A few dwarves though, especially those of Nordmansch and Alpentor, still hew to the older ways, forging rings of surpassing power and loveliness, alive with the circling strength of runes, binding raw arcane might and turning it to fire and shadow, to glamours as durable as stone.",
								"These dwarves, the ring wardens and the ring mystics, are the keepers of lore said to have been handed down by bearded Wotan himself. Their understanding of embodying magic in physical form is rarely surpassed, and they took a keen interest in House von Holzanger. When the human house was weak, they showed up one day, told Gerhardt III that they would be his new soldiers and providers, and somehow either charmed him (some say the gift of an enchanted ring secured Gerhardt III's cooperation) or won him through bribery (others say that the ring mystics shared their secrets of binding arcane essences into circular form and that Gerhardt himself forged dozens of powerful rings in this manner).",
								"In either case, suddenly there was a company of 100 dwarves and a half-dozen ring mages in the village of Redleaf\u2014and many arguments with the locals over the paucity of ale and proper sausages. The dwarves chased down and tamed owlbears as hunting animals and guardians for the newly built Dwarf Hall in the village, a fine dwarven-style structure with a lookout tower. A palisade was raised to protect the village from woodland raiders. And relations between villagers and dwarves never improved. The dwarves followed Ninkash a bit too closely, often drunk and pissing in the streets or singing their endless songs late at night. The dwarven hall was a bit too fine and too imposing. Brawls were common, though the humans had much the worst of it. Complaints to Baron Gerhardt went unheeded. The owlbears ate local goats and chickens and once a beloved dog.",
								"One night while most of the dwarves were digging at the old Scarlet Manor Hall, the Dwarf Hall burned to the ground. The streets of Redleaf glowed very bright, and the humans sang their own songs of Khors. Some of the Redleaf druids and doughtier men-at-arms mused about throwing the dwarves out entirely and \"rescuing\" Baron Gerhardt from their evil influences.",
								"Baron Gerhardt finally saw the danger of further strife between the humans and dwarves. He called the dwarves to stay at the manor house and keep and told them to build it into a finer citadel with a new name: the Scarlet Citadel. The owlbears left the village of Redleaf to live with the dwarves, coming to the riverside village only occasionally when the baron's dwarves came calling. These grim.faced dwarves came twice a year to collect taxes or gather up barrels of ale from Peltzenheim or to send furs to their dwarven brothers in Melana and Brescia. The dungeons beneath the Scarlet Citadel were vastly expanded and improved to include owlbear stables, barracks, shrines to dwarven gods, and a vast library and workspace carved out for the von Holzangers.",
								"The dwarves brought more than rings and owlbears to the Scarlet Citadel. They also brought the faith of Charun the Boatman with them from Melana, and over time, they connected some elements of the citadel with the Black River of Tears, sacred to Charun and said to be a source of connection between the mortal world and Yggdrasil or between Midgard and the many realms of the outer planes.",

								"About 130 years ago, the dwarves of the Scarlet Citadel grew impatient with what seemed like plentiful coin and ale, plus the fine magical treasures they occasionally gained from the von Holzangers. Tired of hunting and guarding and drinking, and led by the canny Captain {@creature Chansar the Pale|KPSC}, they began to take empty carts pulled by enormous tamed owlbears out to the Schio-Wagenstein Road where they plundered merchants and rolled away with fine steel from Melana, copper bars, leather hides from Trombei, spices from Triolo, barrels of salt fish from Friula, and strings of Septime coin. This banditry was small at first, a trader here, a lone peddler there, but it quickly grew into a business of serious danger for trade between the Seven Cities and the Crossroads.",
								"Trade is always dangerous of course, especially among the Septime cities, so the usual precautions were taken. Merchants hired guards, which slowed the banditry but made some trade quite difficult; the price of salt fish won't support a squadron of lancers. Rewards were posted.",
								"For years, various cantonal dwarves and the dwarves of Melana were blamed, for the canny dwarves of the Scarlet Citadel displayed shields and banners of Tijino, Juralt, and Melana or of famous mercenary companies within the Seven Cities. In time, however, it became clear that these dwarves lived to the east of the road, and that they operated from some stronghold in the White Forest. Given the notorious strength of the forest's owlbears and the well-known dangers of the sorcerers of the Scarlet Citadel taking offense at trespassers, the merchants all agreed that someone else should seek out the bandit stronghold and put a stop to the whole mess. The rewards grew larger.",
								"The end of the bandit era came in a different way when canny Captain Chansar bragged a bit too loudly at Redleaf's tavern, the Cage. A young squire of the Faithful Knights of Khors was visiting the village as part of a simple devotional journey to the shrine there, and she overheard this boasting about pillaging a full mule train, so Squire Emmalyn told her sergeant of the bragging dwarven bandit. The paladins and faithful knights of Khors had recently had one of their own wine shipments from the Smolten Hills plundered by bandits, and the order's commander was incensed. A wing of knights, a squad of the Wands of Khors battle mages, and the high priest of Khors in Zigistad himself all followed the young squire Emmalyn into the White Forest to Redleaf village and then to the citadel.",
								"When the dwarves refused to hand over Captain Chansar and his accomplices to the king's justice and the mercy of Khors, the knights laid siege to the citadel for a month. In time, owlbears within the citadel ate all there was to eat, and canny Chansar sent the starving beasts out the citadel gate, expecting to make short work of the knights. He was quite mistaken; High Priest Tadeas Toller struck the owlbears with holy fire, the Wands of Khors unleashed lightning, and the countercharge carried the knights into the citadel courtyard.",
								"The battle might yet have gone to the dwarves with their crossbows firing into the courtyard from well-built arrow slits if not for the fine timbers of the keep catching fire when a lucky fireball went through an arrow slit into the interior. The Scarlet Citadel floors, stairs, rafters, and tapestries burned bright and strong, and the conflagration quickly poured smoke into the buildings, the dungeons, and the courtyard. It became impossible to shoot through the smoke and soon to breath within the tower. The smoke and flames drove a few dwarves into the deeper tunnels, though most were forced to surrender to the waiting company of knights. Captain Chansar's body was never found, and his ring mystic lieutenant Valence Hellhand is known to have survived and fled to Nordmansch. The citadel walls still stood, blackened with smoke, and the dungeons below were no longer home to dozens of owlbears.",
								"But the age of the Scarlet Citadel as a functional fortress were over and done, and the cracked, blackened mortar and missing rafters meant that the walls themselves were weakened. Soon other inhabitants came to the citadel, and the villagers of Redleaf came to gather up useful stone blocks and take them by wagon to reinforce their own keep and palisade. Their scarlet stones, carried for miles and used with care. And one morning, a mysterious red tower was erected, making such a fine impression overlooking the village, which was soon renamed Redtower, and it has kept that name ever since."

								"The sack of the Scarlet Citadel affected the village of Redtower very little indeed. Timber was still cut, some logs rafted down to Triolo to build the fleets, many of the finest timbers going north to the Magdar plain for houses, barrels, all the things one wants stout oak and maple and ash for. A few arcanists came to sniff around at the ruins, though most left quickly once they met the feral owlbears or were vexed by the sprites and pixies and alseid who guarded the forest paths against intruders.",
								"However, one group came not by forest path but by shadow road, powered by the Wandering Crow ley line. These were the cultists of Charun, the boatman between the living and the dead, whose followers took a pilgrimage from Kammae-Straboli along the Black River (as they call their temples' shadow roads) and wound up underneath the citadel. The whole company of pilgrims was quite confused at first, but the shadow fey wizard Quendreth the Wise immediately saw the power and strange geomantic convergence of the site. He insisted that a shrine be built immediately, and he brought in shadow fey guards and mages to embed it with power and bind the ley line.",
								"The small community could not find its way back to Kammae via the river, but with Quendreth's help, they did establish shadow river connections far and wide, both deep into the Shadow Realm and to the three titanic ley lines to the west, north, and south-east. Sometimes the Black River flowed south, powered the Wandering Crow to the White Road and thus to Revskaya, Raguza, Achillon, and occasionally Harkesh. Other seasons brought connections west and north to Brescia and even St. Mischau along the shadow road, once even to Zobeck. The most difficult connections were those along the Pontoretto, sometimes to Trombei and sometimes as far as Capleon. Charun's faithful used the Black River connection quietly and without fuss, retaining it as a secret of the deeper initiates of the Temple of Charun. And even to those who never traveled the shadow rivers, it knit the community together with a physical embodiment of their faith, though only Quendreth truly seemed to understand how to pilot a vessel to connect the shadow roads, a secret he shared with no others. Or at least with no humans.",
								"With the cult of Charun ensconced in the lower levels of the citadel, trading with inhabitants of the underworld and using the ley line to strengthen its presence from the Seven Cities to the heart of the Dragon Empire, things changed. The arcane power of the von Holzangers was passed to the Boatman's followers. Quendreth was suddenly held in very high esteem among the congregants who had once made their pilgrimages entirely on the surface world, and he was granted the title of Ferryman within the church. A period of 15 years kept him at the forefront of Charun's works over a vast territory.",
								"Alas, Quendreth was as susceptible to hubris and arrogance as many of the shadow fey, and he dabbled in void magic, opening portals to other planes entirely, speaking to demons and devils and inviting the satarre priestess Miskra ai-Vellec to advise him. This went about as well as you might expect, for even a less zealous priestess such as Miskra was delighted to have such power in her hands\u2014a tool for her own plans\u2014though she also shared much lore with Quendreth, and the two were allies of convenience for a decade. In time though, the satarre void cultists and the true believers of Charun fell out with each other but not before Miskra realized that she could use the waters of the Black River for certain dark rituals and malign enchantments. In time, the void cult arrived in force, and Quendreth was forced to leave quickly.",
								"When the shadow fey wizard departed, he did... something to the ley line that entirely removed its ability to easily connect to the Pontoretto or the shadow road, and its connection to the White Road remained flickering at best. At the same time, Quendreth brought one of the von Holzangers back to the Scarlet Citadel, the child of Gerhardt IV, to hold the place and the White Forest in perpetuity (more precisely until their return). He was called Gerhardt the Changeling and had a definite elfmarked look to him. He lived for 100 years, and at 70, he took a human wife from Raguza, said to be a pirate captain and certainly a hellraiser. Her name was Melanchia the Reaver, and {@creature Gellert the Gruesome|KPSC} is her son."

His son and daughter\u2014Garent and Vespertina\u2014are said to await the day he dies and his personal bond to the Wandering Crow ends, giving them power to use ley line energies for their friends among the fey and the cults.",

A small tributary of the Templine flows from the southwest to the northeast on the far side of the village.",

While predatory, these adventure peddlers are not lying about the dangers of the citadel: everyone in Redtower knows that few who venture into the citadel ever return.",
