						"It begins with a subtle question. What are we? Where can we go? What are we meant to be? Those are things many young aspiring practitioners asked, before discovering the only means for an answer: the Art.",
						"The Art of arcane magic has been honed for millenia in Kyrmoria. Ancient civilizations rose and fell, some due to conflicting interests and thirst for power that drove them to infighting, some others due to extraordinary yet devastating experiments.",
						"Nowadays, in times of peace, theologists and scholars of the arcane alike debate constantly over the origin of arcana. Devotees of the divine claim it was a gift bestowed upon mortals by Temporus, the deity of time and magic, while mages support the idea of the mortal claim, the fact that magic was always there, embracing us through the Weave. We just had to understand it in order to manipulate it.",
						"Historically, there have been, as is to be expected, great leaps in the development of the Art in times of war. The Dragon War saw many powerful archmages rise and fall, ultimately culminating with the elven archmage Elbalar sacrificing himself in the Nexus of Time to shift the current timeline and alter reality, successfully, for the time being, avoiding a material and celestial plane wide apocalypse.",
						"It is the writer's conviction, as Elbalar's student, that magic is not panacea. A mage's duty is to influence the world, to pursue truths and knowledge as a tool of understanding. As alluring as the concept of the True Magic is, one should tread carefully and with responsibility regarding their craft's use.",
						"After the Sundering, magic has been.. unstable. Even wizards of the highest caliber exercise patience for Celestial and Material Nexuses alignments, so that they can channel their most powerful spells. Not to mention, the use of conjuration as a means for teleportation and such, has produced many results some would deem interesting, at the very least. The mana, the material from which the threads of the Weave are carefully woven are scarce, and since there is peace, the cycle of replenishment from the Celestial planes has halted.",
						"Where does this leave us? Kyrmorians have practiced magic for ages, honing the Art to such lengths that even mages are able to perform feats only powerful clerics could, in the past. But, with the limitations placed upon us for the last 300 years, the process has been a slow, yet dedicated one. We cannot say what the future holds, but one thing is certain. Masters of Arcana still walk and scry the lands, their arsenal full of powerful tricks and enchantments, racing for the one goal: the one True Magic, and the restoration of the Nexus of Arcana.",
						"This document includes some interesting creations that the writer deems worthy of mention, as well as cataloguing training techniques for the initiated to the Art. To the reader, the writer wishes a good read and extends but a few warnings: do not attempt to impersonate deities, do not attempt teleportation or planar magic without meticulous calculations, and should you come across a Ley Line or a Nexus, do not wish for anything. Seriously.",

								"When the dark god Xyndaran was imprisoned, he scattered pages of his Black Gospel all over the material plane, as a final act of defiance against his fellow deities. And, as is natural, mortal curiosity drove destiny to unfold.",
								"About 6400 years before the Sundering, during what was called the Age of Great Magic, many practitioners of Old Magic, Gramarye, started uncovering pages of the gospel and stuyding its more structured and robust approach towards the manipulation of mana. It was around this time that what would be latter known as \"the Art\" took a proper form, as well as the division of spellcrafting into schools of magic. Yet, many abused this newfound power, falling to the dark temptations hidden in the gospel's pages. This caused Temporus, the dragon god of magic and time to instruct the dragons of the material plane to teach mortals how to manipulate the Weave ethically, without needing to delve into the profane practices of Xyndaran's residual malice.",
								"At some point during this era, two major factions opposed each other: those who abused the Weave, harnessing the dark magics of the gospel, and the disciplines of the dragons, who sought balance. The rising tensions culminated in an epic clash that saw the dark mages defeated, and the emergences of those taught by the great wyrms as the first archmages of history.",
								"However, there is no such thing as no dark spot in history, and while the archmages were celebrating their victory and preparing the world for a new era, others plotted in the shadows. Thendrix Hollow, one of the first archmages, grew curious and greedy, seeking out the secrets of the Black Gospel. He believed that the dragons presented only one side of the coin, and wished to unravel the greater truths of magic. Students gathered around him, as well as other ambitious figures, creating the faction that would survive history to this very day: the Apostles of the Gospel."

Rare records of this event, known as the Sundering, tell of how the stars in the sky fell and blinked out of existence one after the other, as the Dreadlord waged his vengeful war against he makers of the cosmos, now restrained in physical forms and unable to access their true powers. The Dreadlord was eventually defeated, but the aftermath of his actions left magic broken, wild and unpredictable."
