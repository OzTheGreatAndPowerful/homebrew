								"Imagine that you're standing on your favorite D&D world All around you, you may see forests, mountains, swamps, bogs, ruins, cities, or towns. Beneath you, you may find the labyrinthine Underdark, or perhaps the ruins of a long lost civilization. No matter what, you can move around and discover what's waiting for you in these places.",
								"What if you look up, though? Sure, you might see a flying city or a city on a cloud, and you can go there too, but look past that. Go beyond the sky. What if you look up to the stars and you wonder what's up there? One does not simply walk there. You might try flying, but you don't make it far before the spell fails and exhaustion takes over. Airships start to run into issue when air thins... Is this some insuperable barrier to our exploration of fantasy worlds?",
								"Spelljammer says no.",
								"Spelljammer is a D&D campaign setting created by Jeff Grubb and published by TSR, Inc. in 1989. The goal of the setting was to push D&D beyond vanilla fantasy by taking your adventures into the stars. It not only gives us a way to understand what's going on in space if we want to travel there, but it also gives us a way to link various D&D settings together. Your characters from Toril (Forgotten Realms) could visit Oerth (Greyhawk) or Exandria (Critical Role).",
								"Often when we consider bringing our games to space, we reach for ideas from science fiction. While science fiction is wonderful, if your vanilla D&D adventurers traveled up to the stars and found themselves significantly outclassed by everything around them, that might make for a poor adventure and a bad time for your players.",

While science fiction will generally have you in airtight ships with blaster cannons using scanners, Spelljammer will have you on open top ships with siege weaponry and gunpowder cannons, using a spyglass to look at others sailing through space. You won't freeze, you won't blow up, you won't just float away.",
										"All of those laws of physics we know from the real world?  Put it to the side. Spelljammer gives us a universe of magic, one that follows a different set of rules than the real world.  Instead of Star Wars or Star Trek, we are talking Treasure Planet or Pirates of the Carribean in space. You're sailors, except instead of sailing the ocean blue, fighting sea monsters, pirates, and finding islands with buried treasure, you're sailing through space, fighting off space monsters, pirates, and finding asteroids with buried treasure."

										"If you've ever been interested in Spelljammer and have looked around, you'll find more than a couple adaptations of Spelljammer to D&D 5e. You might ask why? Why make another Spelljammer supplement when there are so many already? The answer for me is simple: I'm not a fan of the vehicle combat system in D&D. While D&D 5e has started to make some steps in the right direction with Ghosts of Saltmarsh and Descent Into Avernus, there are other tabletop role-playing systems that have advanced vehicle mechanics in cool ways. In this supplement, it is my goal to adapt mechanics from those other systems for D&D 5e and use it in the Spelljammer universe.",
										"So the most important thing to note right now is this: If you're looking for a faithful adaptation of Spelljammer 2e to 5e, this supplement isn't that.",
										"In this document, what you'll find is a 5e-compatible system for running vehicle combat based off of the ship combat system designed by Mage Hand Press for their Dark Matter campaign setting. While I have made many changes to their system to adapt it to Spelljammer, the system used here is ultimately derived from their system. I made use of this system because it makes vehicle combat mirror the D&D 5e mechanics we are already familiar with from normal combat. Check out Mage Hand Press and Dark Matter for more!",
										"In addition to this different approach to vehicle mechanics, this supplement includes homebrew lore in addition to much of the traditional Spelljammer lore. I have borrowed heavily from conversations with people on the Spelljammer Discord, the Spelljammer subreddit, the Spelljammer board on The Piazza, Beyond Two Moons, and from the Sages of Spelljammer on Facebook to build this supplement out. Just be aware that some lore in here isn't from the original Spelljammer books."

										"Chapter 2 is going to focus entirely on spelljammers themselves, the ships that carry people through space. In any Spelljammer game, the spelljammer is almost like a party member. It's a combination of their home, their transportation, and their defense against beasts in space.  This section will go over the different parts of a spelljammer, some customization you can do, example spelljammer stat blocks, and finally the rules for ship combat.",
										"Chapter 3 will go briefly over divinity across the planes.  Since spelljammer unifies many settings, it put in some rules to nullify conflict between gods of different settings.",

						"Spelljammer isn't a projection into the future, but instead a love letter to the aesthetic of the Age of Sail The Age of Sail was a time from roughly the late-1500s to the mid-1800s that is defined by the exploration of the world, the dominance of naval warfare, gunpowder weapons, piracy, trading companies, and privateers. We didn't know as much about the universe as we do today, which means we had a number of neat ideas that were ultimately debunked, but were nonetheless kind of interesting. Since Spelljammer is all about this aesthetic, it makes these beliefs into truth. The goal is to create a universe where traveling through space is similar to people setting sail to the new world.",
						"As I go through this section explaining how the universe works, I'm going to be comparing things against the locations a ship would be concerned with during the Age of Sail.  Hopefully this will help you see how the aesthetic of Spelljammer is constantly referencing this age in history.",

I'm going to be going for the second approach here, starting with what a D&D character would be familiar with, and then zooming out until we've captured the whole universe.",

										"Lets say you're living on Toril, the planet of Forgotten Realms.  One night, you leave the walls of Waterdeep and look up to the stars. You'd already likely be aware of a few major things that exist high above. You'd know of the sun that warms and lights the day. You'd be aware of Selune, the moon of Toril.  You'd also be aware of the glittering asteroids around Selune called Selune's Tears. Lastly, you'd know there are stars.",
										"There's far more than this out there, such as the planet beneath your feet, other planets, ring worlds, floating cities on chunks of rock, and just about anything you can imagine.  All of these count as being celestial bodies. An important thing to remember is that these celestial bodies are crafted and sculpted, rather than a byproduct of natural forces.",
										"I bring up this distinction because it means that celestial bodies are not bound to the normal laws of physics in how they are shaped. You can have ring-worlds that aren't just futuristic technology, but made of natural materials like any other planet. You can have a ribbon of water flowing in and between asteroids in an asteroid belt. You can have a planet that is completely hollow and people live on the inside surface of the sphere. You can have square worlds. Triangular worlds. Disc worlds. You are not bound to how physics shaped celestial bodies in the real world, they were crafted by gods and the results of godswars long since forgotten. What is possible in space is limited only by your imagination.",
										"Comparing this against the experiences of a ship during the Age of Sail, a celestial body is like a port or an island. You can go there to resupply if it is a port, you can make landfall if you need to bury some treasure, or anything like that."

										"Now let's say you decide you want to leave your planet. You decide you want to go \"up there\" and see what's going on. You want to go to the moon, to the sun, to the asteroids you can see, or potentially any other thing your DM has placed in that system. After you travel up for long enough away from your planet, you'll eventually reach a threshold where air and gravity stop. This is the boundary between a planet and what we call wildspace.",
										"Wildspace is probably easiest just to define as what we normally think of as space. It's the empty black void up there that stuff moves around in. It is the place that celestial bodies reside, the inky sea through which the spelljammers sail, and the lair of numerous beasts.",
										"In my ongoing comparison, think of wildspace as the sea, and the celestial bodies within it like islands. This isn't exactly the ocean, instead think of wildspace like the Caribbean Sea which hosts a wide variety of islands and port cities. So when we look at the wildspace of Forgotten Realms, it's like we're looking at a region of islands.",

									]

								{
									"type": "section",
									"name": "Gravity",
									"id": "Gravity",
									"entries": [
										"The first challenge you face in leaving your planet (island) is gravity. Think of gravity kind of like a powerful rip tide, pulling you back in whenever you try to leave. Unlike in real life, gravity is an all-or-nothing force. It's either on or it's off.  When it is on, it pulls like earth-normal gravity, and when it is off, it doesn't pull at all. In other words, gravity doesn't get stronger or weaker based on the source, it only goes out farther from the source. Anything that is at least 25 feet in a dimension is a source of gravity.",
										"Now you might ask, how does this never come up in a normal game? The answer has to do with how gravity fields overlap. When there are two sources in close contact, the larger gravity field trumps the smaller one. Since nothing on a planet, not even a Tarrasque, is bigger than the planet itself, the planet's gravity always wins. When in wildspace, gravity fields can overlap, so long as their sources don't touch.",
										"Another odd feature about gravity is that it is defined as always pulling in the direction most convenient for the source. This usually results in a single gravity source that pulls all things toward it. For example, a planet will always pull you toward the core. A titanic sized giant would have a gravity field under its feet, allowing it to walk through space as if there were ground under its feet. Ships have a gravity plane that pull crew members down to the deck. So long as they don't get too close to a planet, they're fine!",
										"This has some fun outcomes worth considering. First, imagine a classic Age of Sail style ship, like from Pirates of the Caribbean. There's a main deck, sails, masts, and all of that. The gravity field runs horizontally along the main deck, meaning that when you are standing on the top deck, you're pulled down to it. If you go inside the ship, the floor of the first floor is the bottom side of the main deck! Luckily, most ships that go into space are designed to make the gravity field pull to the lowest deck, so this doesn't always come up.",
										"Another neat image of this is if you were to fall off the side of a spelljammer, you'd fall down until you cross the gravity plane, but then your momentum would be flinging you up against gravity. You'd be pulled back up to the field and flung up a bit, before being pulled back down. So you'd bobble up and down at the gravity plane. This also means that when you go below deck, you need to fall forward and up, so the first floor you're on is the underside of the deck of the ship. To go deeper into the ship, you have to climb stairs or ladders.",
										"Groundlings never have to deal with this because a planet is so large that its gravity field nullifies anything else that could ever create one short of magical means."

										"The second challenge is air. How are you supposed to breath when you get up there? Won't we just suffocate? Luckily not!  In the Spelljammer universe, all creatures and objects have an air bubble around them proportional to their size. This is a lot like the gravity field (and conveniently, they are always the same size), except that all things have an air bubble while only particularly large things have gravity. What this means is that as soon as you find a way off of your planet's gravity field, you're also going to be beyond the planet's air envelope.",
										"While in wildspace, you only have the air that you bring with you. Since spelljammers are so large, they carry a sizable air bubble with them wherever they go. Similarly, massive creatures like dragons that fly through space carry their own air bubble that can sometimes be enough to sustain them for trips. However, you do run the risk of using up all your air! Every spelljammer has a number of days it can sustain people. When this period expires, the air becomes foul and gives all creatures that breath disadvantage on all checks. The second time it expires, the air becomes lethal and all creatures that breath gain a point of exhaustion each minute they breath the lethal air.",
										"Luckily, getting new air isn't too difficult! Whenever two air envelopes come into contact, the air distributes itself evenly between the overlapping envelopes. If two equal sized air envelopes overlap, and one of them is completely fresh and the other just hit lethal, they both split the difference and become foul. This isn't the best way to get new air.",
										"The most common way to get new air is to bring the spelljammer close enough to a planet that the spelljammer's air envelope overlaps with the planet's air envelope. The planet has so much air, the spelljammer's air bubble is replenished in full. It is also possible to replenish an air bubble from air pockets found around asteroids, though the air supply here is less plentiful than a planet.",

										"Okay, we now know that planets have gravity that works against our efforts to leave and if we do leave, we're going to be bringing just a small bit of air with us. So how do we escape from the gravity of a planet and reach wildspace? The answer lies in the aether.",
										"The idea of the aether comes from ancient times and survived through to the medieval era. As simply as it can be stated, the idea is that there can't be a nothing, so there must be a something. There is a substance to space, it isn't just void, and that substance is aether. As recently as the 19th century, there were arguments that aether as matter was necessary for light to travel through space. This theory is dead in the water in modern day, but that's the idea of aether.",
										"Wildspace is fully comprised of an invisible substance called aether. Previously I had described wildspace as a sea with islands. In that comparison, aether would be the water that makes up the sea. Like water, aether can have flows that help travel or storms that hamper it. A Helmsman that is attuned to a Helm can perceive the aether as a luminescent bluish substance that they sail on.",
										"This aether is important to us because it is the way we escape from our planet. Although a planet is surrounded mostly by air, there are also aether currents that connect the sky to wildspace. These currents go unnoticed by groundlings thanks to them being invisible, but a Helmsman attuned to a Helm can easily find them and sail olut into space.",
										"If a planet is an island, wildspace is the sea, the aether is the water that comprises the sea, then these aether currents are like large rivers, bays, and inlets. These make navigating from an island to the sea significantly easier. Just as different groups during the Age of Sail looked to control port cities, bays, and riverways, so too do factions in Spelljammer seek to control these points of entry into and out of a planet.",
										"To bring that comparison even further, just like natural rivers, bays, and harbors, it is possible for a catastrophe to occur that causes them to dry up and no longer provide any access to sailing ships! What if some major magical catastrophe befalls a planet and it causes the aether currents to get scrambled? Well, that's going to cause a rush to control the new locations! Or worse, what if there are no ways to get down to that planet anymore?",
										"The idea of aether is not one originally present in Spelljammer. In Spelljammer, simply having a Helm with a spellcaster is sufficient to propel the spelljammer free of the gravity of a planet. I choose to incorporate this idea as I think it plays nicely with the Age of Sail aesthetic."

										"Alright! You've escaped from your planet (island) and you've sailed through the aether (water) all around wildspace (the sea), Eventually you wonder what lies beyond this sea? Where is the ocean in this comparison? You turn your spelljammer and set sail away from the planets (islands) that you know.",
										"Get ready, this is where things get weird.",
										"You pick a star and you set sail toward it. You're traveling at top speed, enthusiastic and a bit terrified of what the future might hold. You have that same anxious optimism as Truman Burbank sailing out across the water that had kept him trapped at home in The Truman Show (1998). Like Truman, you're in for a big surprise when your spelljammer stops.",
										"You walk to the front of your spelljammer and reach out.  You touch a barrier. That blackness you saw so long ago when you were back on your planet is a wall, a shell surrounding wildspace on every side. What you would be touching is called a crystal sphere.",
										"A crystal sphere is a construct so large it can envelope a solar system (or more!) within it. This idea is based on the celestial spheres theory presented by people such as Plato, Aristotle, Ptolemy, Eudoxus, and Copernicus. The theory holds that our solar system is surrounded by a shell with stars affixed to its interior.",
										"Spelljammer makes use of crystal spheres as boundaries between D&D settings. When you leave a crystal sphere, you are leaving that setting and its rules behind Even the power of the gods is limited by the barrier of a crystal sphere. No matter how strong a god might be in Forgotten Realms, that power doesn't extend to Dragonlance or Exandria.",
										"In the same way, it allows each setting to play by its own rules without interfering with other settings. It's almost like each crystal sphere contains its own little universe. Want a low magic setting? Maybe a sci-fi setting? Maybe one where people are slowly driven insane due to an eldritch horror living in the sun? Maybe you want a sphere that just has a bunch of space turtles with worlds on their backs. All of this is possible without influencing another setting by simply containing it in a crystal sphere.",
										"Passing through a crystal sphere can be a bit of a chore for anew adventurer. Natural portals appear and disappear seemingly at random along the crystal sphere. These portals can be located with lower level divination spells for the starting spelljammer crew, however with higher level magic or the right equipment on the spelljammer, portals can be created when required."

In the same way a sailor leaves the waters of the Caribbean behind to set sail across the open ocean, your spelljammer sets sail from wildspace into the rainbow ocean known as the phlogiston.",
										"Also called \"the Flow\", the phlogiston is a highly flammable rainbow substance that fills the space between spheres.  Picture a fish tank, infinite in size and full of a rainbow substance. Floating around in that substance are golf balls that slowly drift around. Within each of these golf balls exists a system, a D&D setting. This is the universe of Spelljammer at its highest point.",
										"That said, the phlogiston has some odd properties. First, if ignited, the fire always seems to backfire, resulting in many, many failed attempts to weaponize it. Even if it was weaponized, the phlogiston dissipates in a matter of seconds when it crosses the threshold of a crystal sphere. No one is sure why this happens, but it is a good thing. If the phlogiston were ever to flow into a crystal sphere, it would quickly find its way to the sun and destroy the entire solar system.",
										"Even more oddly, the phlogiston seems to block any dimensional, planar, or conjuration magic. You may have wondered why anyone would worry about food when you can have a spellcaster conjure food & water. This is why.  Teleportation, plane shifting, conjuring food, speaking to a planar being, even using a bag of holding all fail in the phlogiston (though the bag of holding does resume functionality when back in wildspace!) Simply put, while you're in the phlogiston, you are completely blocked off from the outside world",
										"As a result, even gods can't influence what goes on in the phlogiston. While a cleric, paladin, warlock, or anyone else who draws their power froma planar source is able to cast spells in the phlogiston, they don't recover spell slots above 2nd-level until they return to wildspace.

When we run a game of Spelljammer that allows characters from one setting to travel to another, we are directly confronted with an issue: How do we deal with the fact that people from Eberron can only see and interact with planes in the Eberron source material when they goto a different setting?",

One of the challenges of all the campaigns existing in the same reality, was that there are small differences like gods, for example, some of which overflow into other campaigns and others which do not. And things like the constellations of Krynn moving around. Crystal spheres, enclosing each solar system in its own container, were the answer to that."

In Spelljammer, the answer is rather simple: No matter how strong a god is in one sphere, that power doesn't translate to another sphere. No matter how hegemonic their power may be in their sphere, the sphere itself is a hard limit. Ifa god wishes to have power in another sphere, they need expand their religion and get followers in that sphere.",

As the party moves their spelljammer from spot to spot, the DM moves the planets at regular time intervals so they revolve around the circle once every planetary year.",

You put in planet names, sizes, orbit speeds, etc. Once that's done, you override the equations in the \"Starting Position\" column with the numbers that it randomly generates. From that point on, you can change the time elapsed number at the top of the page (cell F1) and it will automatically move all planets and recalculate relative distances. Using the travel calculator on the right, you can find the amount of time it takes to get between any two points in the sphere."

If you were to throw them up against enemies with offensive capabilities to match the far more durable Hammership, the Threshership would get devoured.  As such, you need to balance your encounters to the party and their spelljammer.",

								"Howdy reader! Something I've noticed about a lot of these supplements is that there isn't usually any time devoted to the author discussing things about the supplement. I've spoken to a lot of people over the past many months working on this, and it has only reinforced my belief that I should add a page like this for DMs. Just a time for me to talk about the design of this system in a non-formal way. I apologize, this isn't going to be particularly well organized. I'm more or less writing stream of consciousness here.",

										"Running a Spelljammer game can be rather intimidating at first glance. It is quite possible to end up with a great deal of choice paralysis, where having so many options leaves one unsure of what to do. What I've found by talking to different people who run Spelljammer is that they all tend to run things in different ways. I know one fellow that loves to pick a single sphere and just focus in on what's going on in that space. They love to use established lore to build into something cool. The more I run Spelljammer, the more I love using the freedom it provides to create interesting and cool worlds that are fun for players to explore. I tend to like games that go from sphere to sphere, where each sphere has its own unique traits and qualities, much like how each planet in The Outer Wilds was different and interesting. There are others I know who like to use their party's spelljammer as a base of operations for a West Marches style game, approaching Spelljammer like Star Trek: The Next Generation. Each short story is another \"episode\".",
										"The point I am getting at is that because Spelljammer offers you endless freedom, you have to choose your boundaries, the things you like to run and that which helps the story you want to tell. The only wrong way to run a Spelljammer game is to run one you're not having fun with. You don't have to go through the phlogiston. You don't have to do crew management.  You don't even have to do ship combat. Everyone I've met who runs Spelljammer runs it in their own way.",
										"When I've talked about this in the past with people, I've heard from some that Spelljammer as a setting can seem limiting. Think of how weird gravity is in Spelljammer. How do you add in more sci-fi when the fundamental reality is so not scientific? Consider what a crystal sphere really is and what it lets you do. It puts a discrete barrier on where the rules of one setting end and another begins. If you want to run something more scientific based, just put it in a sphere! Maybe your party happens upon a galactic sized crystal sphere that contains the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe and One Above All is the overgod of that sphere, the way Ao is to Forgotten Realms and Boccob is to Greyhawk. Maybe another sphere contains the Star Trek galaxy. How does your ship maintain gravity and air? Just say the helm manages it in spite of the physics of the new setting. Boom, you've got yourself a setting crossover.",
										"This might seem a bit crazy, but remember that we're talking about D&D. The universe is crazy in D&D.  There's the Blood War, mind flayers, a new apocalypse every Tuesday in Forgotten Realms, there are figures that reshape reality using magic. The universe in D&D is fantastical. Embrace it and shape it into something you're passionate about and will have fun with! If that means sci-fi, add sci-fi. If that means steampunk, make steampunk ships. Spelljammer gives you the keys to the universe. Make it yours."

										"In this supplement, I presented a scale of play called mega scale, which is as close to ground scale as possible, just multiplied by 100. Every so often, I am asked about how I deal with these scales crossing one another. After all, if you have a ballista on a ship, why can't you just turn it and target an individual person ona ship 30 feet away from you?",
										"Simply put, the difference in scale is here to create a clear line between the mechanics of ground and ship combat. For the sake of making ship combat easy to use, this scale difference allows us to eschew a great deal of micromanagement that would otherwise bog down a game. Imagine being in a ship fight and needing to track the individual hit points of every single crew member of both ships.",
										"Nevertheless, the party has a medium ballista that deals 2d6 mega piercing damage. What do you do if they want to use that against a dragon? That 7 mega damage is 700 hit points! That will kill Tiamat if it hits! Obviously, you don't want to trivialize everything by mixing these two scales. Instead, just use the DMG rules for siege weapons (pg. 255) when ship weapons are turned on ground targets. Keep everything simple and clean. The party will probably favor just using their own class features instead."

										"Every so often, I'll talk to people who feel that there is just too much Spelljammer lore for them to learn that they'd rather avoid the setting. To this, I offer the same advice as I would for using the lore of any setting: lore is a tool, use what is helpful and disregard what isn't.  Ed Greenwood, the original creator of the Forgotten Realms, once wrote on twitter:",
										"\"Both [Lost Empires of Faerun] and the Grand History are written by unreliable narrators looking at the past from much later; everything in them is subject to the same distortions of history that happen in the real world, when we moderns look back and misinterpret writings and artefacts of ancient civilizations from our modern points of view. This is absolutely key to understanding the Realms: from my earliest writings about it, long before it was a D&D world or D&D even existed, we were seeing the Realms through the eyes of unreliable narrators. The published D&D Realms setting has always been 'brought to us.  by' Elminster (and Laeral, and Volo, anda few others)...\"",
										"I think this approach to lore is a great one. Lore isn't meant to be a constraint, it's meant to give you ideas to jump off of, set pieces on the stage for you to write around. Maybe the things we thought happened in lore didn't actually happen and were instead maligned by history. You can make it your own."

When a spelljammer moves, they can move up to their speed within a cone of movement equal to that maneuverability score.

				"Spelljammers are not generally mass produced in a factory. You're unlikely to find automated production lines crafting hulls, ship mounted weapons, or modules in one of the many spelljamming port cities.  The vast majority of spelljammers were, at some point or another, crafted by a person or group of people who have their own personal preferences, goals for the spelljammer, and/or artistic vision. Like the creations of shipwrights during the Age of Sail, each spelljammer carries the unique signature of the person or people who originally crafted it.",
				"That said, we can generally categorize spelljammers into types based on similar aesthetic style or design philosophy. Think of this as a picture that we show two different artists and ask them to reproduce. Each of those artists will bring their own unique flavor and style to it, resulting in two variations of the same original picture.",
				"In this section, I'm going to talk about these types and offer a starting stat block for NPC spelljammers or as a starting point for PC spelljammers. All of these stat blocks are generalized and each will vary based on the shipwright that created it. Weapons may vary from those shown on the stat block and attack bonuses definitely vary based on the character using them in spelljammer combat.",
				"As you look through this section and you see spelljammers like the Hammership, remember that just because it appears to be made of wood doesn't mean it has to be. Imagine if the party puts in a work order for a Hammership with a dwarven shipwright.  That spelljammer ight end up being created out of metal i ated of wood, resulting in more AC but slower movement speed. Imagine if the party puts in a work order for a Hammership with an elven shipwright. That elf might grow the spelljammer from the starfly plant, making the ship more maneuverable than it normally would be but less heavily armored.",

				"If you've been reading through this supplement in order, you've probably noticed the word \"mega\" a lot.  In this system, there are two levels at which combat can occur: ground scale and mega scale. Ground scale is the the standard combat scale that you're used to from other fifth edition settings. Mega scale is anew system for dealing with combat between massive constructs and creatures. When it comes to using a spelljammer to destroy a massive space kraken or krajen, a rogue moon, or another spelljammer, we're talking about mega scale encounters.",
				"Mega scale can best be understood by applying a rule of thumb called the \"Rule of 100\". At ground scale, a square is 5 feet by 5 feet. At mega scale, a square is 500 feet by 500 feet. At ground scale, we have damage and hit points. At mega scale, we have mega damage and mega hit points, which are the same as the ground scale equivalent, except multiplied by 100.",
				"The purpose of mega scale is to have a clear divide between types of encounters. When you're doing a ground encounter, player characters are using their normal class features, weapons, and spells to destroy enemies. When doing a mega encounter, player characters are using class features, mega weapons, and mega spells to destroy their enemies.",
				"Now you might ask, \"If I deal 5 mega damage, meaning I am doing 500 damage, wouldn't that trivialize ground combat?\" Right you are! For this reason, weapons and spells that deal mega damage are unable to target creatures and objects on ground scale or when within the presence of large gravity fields such as a planet or settlement). Mega scale weaponry is designed only for use in mega scale encounters.  One thing that doesn't scale up to mega scale is time.",
				"A single round of combat is still six seconds.",

					"type": "entries",
					"name": "Grid Combat",
					"page": 34,
					"entries": [
						"Part of the benefit of splitting up ground scale and mega scale is that it makes it easy to deal with combat.  Just as you control a character in ground scale combat, you control a part of a spelljammer in mega scale combat. While a ground scale grid might have you move 30 feet across 5 foot by 5 foot squares, resulting in you moving 6 squares, mega scale is arranged so you would move 3,000 feet across 500 foot by 500 foot squares, resulting in moving 6 squares.",
						"In other words, when dealing with things in mega scale combat, the goal is for it to work as close to ground scale combat as possible, just scaled up. You still roll initiative and take your own turn, just as you would in a ground scale combat."

Each of these convey a specific way in which the attack happen. In mega scale, we use a different type of attack called a {@b Ship Weapon Attack}.",
						"On a character's turn, when a character makes a ship weapon attack, they roll a d20 and add either their Strength or Dexterity modifier (their choice) to the attack roll. Based on circumstances, the DM may call for this roll to be made at advantage (roll twice, take the higher result) or disadvantage (roll twice, take the lower result). The DM checks the total of the attack roll against the target's armor class to confirm if it is a hit or not. On a hit, the character rolls the damage of the ship weapon, but does not add their modifier to the damage roll.",
						"Some classes have features that occur when the character makes an attack or when they hit with a weapon attack, such as Extra Attack, Sneak Attack, or Divine Smite. Characters in the Gunner or Fighter Helmsman role both have access to features that allow these abilities to be used with ship weapon attacks."

The two ships may still be in a side-by-side fight on mega scale while the boarding party are in a ground scale encounter aboard the enemy ship.",
						"Luckily this type of encounter isn't too tricky! Since a round is always 6 seconds regardless of scale, and since everyone rolls their own initiative, those who are on ground scale act on their turns in ground scale, and those who are fighting on mega scale act on their turns in mega scale. Those who board an enemy spelljammer can seriously hamper the ability of that ship to fight back on the mega scale side of the fight."
