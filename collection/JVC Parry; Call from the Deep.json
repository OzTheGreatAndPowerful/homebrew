While attacking a ship as a juvenile, Dhurge came across a {@item wand of fireballs} and quickly realised how to use the item. The power afforded to him by the item inspired him to search out more and more wands until he had a full set. By the time Dhurge was fully grown, he has discovered more wands than his hands could carry and had mastered their use. The arcane casting didn't go down well with the sahuagin of Kressilacc, Dhurge's home, so he headed south to the Nelanthers where he knew he could find work as a pirate. Here he was approached by Sea King Tentrix, who recruited him into the Black Armada.",

He wields a wand in each hand, shooting spells at incredible speed. Dhurge wears a long wizard's robe that is always sodden and is covered in parts by a mossy seaweed.",

Unfortunately, Tentrix's direct link with Slarkrethel, and therefore Zellix'Phor, means the kraken can use an action to deal 90 psychic damage to Tentrix, killing him instantly.

At the height of her power, however, she led a crazed quest to control the Sea of Swords that resulted in her ship vanishing beneath the waves. Blessed by Umberlee and Valkur, the Storm Maiden somehow survived. It took many years for her to return, but she immediately stole a ship from a petty pirate captain and began amasing a new crew.",

After she has done so, she will return to Norland and claim the island for her own. Her mission quickly drew the attention of Sea King Tentrix, who offered her a position of command in the Black Armada should she help him enact his plans.",

She dresses in the usual attire of a Norl; leather armour and breeches with a fur cloak and horned helm. She is a proud woman who believes her blessings from Umberlee and Valkur will guide her to victory",
