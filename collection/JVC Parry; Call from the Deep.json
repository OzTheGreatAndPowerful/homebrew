P. Lovecraft. Additionally, it was inspired by my growing love for the Forgotten Realms, and it has been a delight to be able to play in that world.",

Once that tomfoolery is out of the way, the DM has the chance to take revenge. Otherworldly horror may break the minds of the characters, turning them from notorious captains to broken heroes.",

One way to make an encounter more challenging is to have it trigger a second random encounter.

								"This adventure contains the potential for lots of naval combat. Because of this, you need to note the type of ship the characters are using, it’s speed, required crew, AC, HP, and damage threshold. These statistics can be found in the “Ship Statistics” section.",
								"When naval combat breaks out, have each vessel roll initiative separately from the rest of the characters. The ships have a bonus to initiative equal to the average bonus of the crew. For example, a ship crewed by mostly {@creature guard|mm|guards}, who have a {@dice 1d20+1|+1} to initiative, also has a {@dice 1d20+1|+1} to initiative.",
								"A ship can take the following actions on its turn; {@action Attack}, {@action Dash}, or {@action Dodge}. When a ship takes the {@action Attack} action, assume that it uses all its weapons so long as there are enough crew to use them (remembering that some weapons take multiple action to use). Taking the {@action Dash} action allows a ship to move twice as fast as it normally would, but may require a successful Strength check at the DMs discretion. A ship that {@action Dodge|phb|Dodges} is assumed to be manoeuvred in such a way as to make it harder to hit.",
								"At times, the ship may have to make ability checks or saving throws, for example, to avoid a collision with rocks or an enemy vessel, or perhaps to avoid rocks whilst {@action Dash|phb|Dashing}. Like initiative, refer to the average bonus of the crew.",
								"Ships that are damaged can be repaired. Repairs to a damaged ship can be made while the vessel is berthed. Repairing 1 hit point of damage requires 1 day and costs 20 gp for materials and labour. Ships can also be upgraded (see the “Upgrades” section).",
								"If you don’t think your players will enjoy this, you can run their ship for them, or ignore these rules altogether, and simply run the naval battles in a narrative fashion, relying heavily on the characters actions.",

Dhurge was born with the typical baron mutations (increased strength and extra limbs), but rather than fighting his way to the top of sahuagin society, as most barons do, Dhurge took a different route. While attacking a ship as a juvenile, Dhurge came across a {@item wand of fireballs} and quickly realised how to use the item. The power afforded to him by the item inspired him to search out more and more wands until he had a full set. By the time Dhurge was fully grown, he has discovered more wands than his hands could carry and had mastered their use. The arcane casting didn't go down well with the sahuagin of Kressilacc, Dhurge's home, so he headed south to the Nelanthers where he knew he could find work as a pirate. Here he was approached by Sea King Tentrix, who recruited him into the Black Armada.",

He thinks highly of Tentrix, whose charismatic leadership has united dozens of crews under his command. Dhurge is a four-armed sahuagin with intelligent, beady eyes. He wields a wand in each hand, shooting spells at incredible speed. Dhurge wears a long wizard's robe that is always sodden and is covered in parts by a mossy seaweed.",

					"Hailing from Ulf of Thuger on Trisk, the northernmost of the Purple Rocks, Sea King Tentrix is a kraken priest who works directly for the kraken, Slarkrethel. Since leaving Trisk, Tentrix has amassed a huge cult of followers, most of whom are pirates that serve on the Black Armada. Tentrix coordinated the attacks on the Sword Coast after receiving a telepathic message from Slarkrethel. Tentrix is excited to be taking the fight to the mainland and eagerly awaits the rewards promised to him by the kraken. Tentrix doesn't know that Slarkrethel has been replaced by Zellix'Phor, but he's aware of the Ruins of Ascarle, where Slarkrethel lairs.",
					"Tentrix tries to keep his knowledge secret from everyone, never revealing the full story. Tentrix cares not for his own life, believing the kraken has the ability to bring him back from beyond the grave, but threats to his floating lair crack his stern exterior. If his lair is threatned, he begins to reveal information. Unfortunately, Tentrix's direct link with Slarkrethel, and therefore Zellix'Phor, means the kraken can use an action to deal 90 psychic damage to Tentrix, killing him instantly. Zellix'Phor does this if Tentrix is about to reveal the location of Ascarle.",
					"Tentrix behaves as a pirate king; he is brutal, brash and uncaring. He has devoted his life to worshipping Slarkrethel, gaining a cutthroat reputation, and amassing the nastiest crew of pirate lords he could muster. He's travelled throughout Faerûn to these ends and knows the world's oceans like the back of his hand. Tentrix is inflated with importance, exceedingly arrogant and believes himself undefeatable.",
					"Like most kraken priests, Tentrix has been transformed beyond his human form. He has a face of tentacles that hang down like a twitching, fleshy beard. His eyes ooze ink down his face in staining streams. He wears a flowing leather overcoat and a tricorn hat. Tentrix is rarely seen without his familiar, a {@creature homunculus} named Filch.",
