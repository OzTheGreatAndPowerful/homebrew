P. Lovecraft. Additionally, it was inspired by my growing love for the Forgotten Realms, and it has been a delight to be able to play in that world.",
								"The adventure should inspire players to indulge in the finest tropes of piracy; swinging from the rigging, blasting each other with cannons, and forcing landlubbers to walk the plank. Once that tomfoolery is out of the way, the DM has the chance to take revenge. Otherworldly horror may break the minds of the characters, turning them from notorious captains to broken heroes.",
								"If the characters can hold their own against the horrors of the deep, and of the outer planes, they may emerge triumphant over one of the Realms' most hideous villains."

						"The campaign takes place in the Forgotten Realms, specifically in a region known as the Sword Coast, on the western shore of Faerûn and the seas beyond. Nonetheless, you can easily adapt the adventure to your home campaign by changing the names of various locations and factions.",
						"I recommend that you read the entire campaign before attempting to run it. This introduction begins with an \"{@adventure Adventure Background|CallfromtheDeep|1|Adventure Background}\" section that summarizes the events that set the adventure in motion. The \"{@adventure Running the Adventure|CallfromtheDeep|1|Running the Adventure}\" section tells you everything you need to know to run the adventure smoothly.

The settlements on the coast and the Island Kingdoms of the Sea of Swords and Trackless Sea are the primary settings of this campaign, but other inland locations may feature more prominently during your playthrough. For additional information on these locations, consult the {@book Sword Coast Adventurer’s Guide|scag}.",
								"The coastline itself is perilous and changeable. In the north is the Sea of Moving Ice, filled with great bergs that shatter the hulls of unwary ships. Further south lies calmer waters and friendly ports and cities, such as Neverwinter, Waterdeep, and Baldur’s Gate. Despite the existence of these havens, Red Rocks isn’t the only thing that will sink your vessel. Pirates from Luskan and The Northlander Isles roam the coast, targeting merchant galleys and bullying fishing boats. The seas too are cruel, harbouring hideous monsters, tempestuous squalls and unseen horrors in their depths.",

										"Entirely alien to most of the common folk of the Realms, the illithid, or mind flayers, formed an empire of psionic hive mind slavers who brought devastation to populations of sentient creatures. Over many centuries, and across innumerate worlds, these tentacled nightmares subjected thousands of races to psychic torture, breaking their will and turning them into thralls. Telepathically united, these aberrations traversed the Outer Planes in nautiloids, ships attuned to their needs, in search of races to enslave.",
										"One of these races were the gith. Although they were dominated for centuries by the illithid, somehow the gith revolted against their oppressors, overthrowing their empire and scattering the remaining mind flayers far and wide. Although the details of the uprising are unknown, the illithid and gith (who became two separate races, the githyanki and githzerai), still hold utter contempt for each other. The gith actively seek out Illithid to destroy, and mind flayers seek githyanki crèches on the Material Plane to subjugate and torture. For more information about the gith and illithid conflict, known as the Endless War, see {@book chapter 4 of Mordenkainen’s Tome of Foes|mtf|3}.",
										"In recent times, most surviving Illithid are scattered across the Astral Plane. A few made it to other worlds, where they continue to harvest brains and create thralls. Numerous sects of illithid have taken up home in the Underdark, the vast network of caverns beneath Faerûn. Here, hidden in the shadows, they devour the brains of sentient creatures to sustain themselves.",
										"Illithid culture is founded on knowledge and understanding. As well as consuming brains for sustenance, mind flayers also receive memories and wisdom stored within their victims’ brains, which is immediately transmitted throughout their colony telepathically. At the head of these colonies are Elder Brains. These beings of supreme intelligence manage the illithid communities, accessing the information they hold and using it to further the will of the race. Their goals are known as The Grand Design, which focusses on rebuilding their lost empire, and subjugating their remaining enemies."

Through the absorption of dead illithid brains, Zellix’Phor came to know the causes of the empire’s fall and is obsessed with vengeance. Driven by bloodlust, the illithid colony that follows Zellix’Phor searches across the Planes of Existence for githyanki crèches, hoping to decimate their population through infanticide.",
										"Zellix’Phor had become a name that elated mind flayers and brought dread into the hearts of the gith. His devastating effect upon the githyanki population was well known, and horrifying stories were told within that culture of the silent and deadly arrival of the illithid vessel which housed Zellix’Phor and his disciples.",
										"Over time, the colony of Zellix’Phor grew to a point where it could barely sustain itself. All available nautiloid space was dedicated to the illithid, and their thralls were jettisoned to make room for the superior race. The need for brains to fuel the mind flayers meant that the nautiloid in which the colony lived was visiting the Material Plane ever more frequently. Despite generations of tactical warfare knowledge assimilated by the Zellix’Phor, his arrogance became his downfall. The gith had been tracking the nautiloid across the Planes, waiting for the right time to strike. Believing himself invincible, Zellix’Phor commanded the vessel to dock on the Material Plane to stock up on brains, and the ship was attacked.",
										"Githyanki knights, the fiercest and most formidable warriors of the martial race, struck the nautiloid with immeasurable force. They entered the vessel as assassins and decimated the illithid within. Without their thralls to take the brunt of the assault, the mind flayers were on the front line, and despite their formidable psionic capabilities, many were struck down by the silver swords of the Githyanki. The nautiloid crash-landed on the Northlander Isle of Gundarlun, killing nearly all aboard. Unfortunately, Zellix’Phor and his closest attendants managed to survive, sheltered from the destruction in the elder brain chamber of the nautiloid.

The elder brain is arrogant and believes themselves to be invincible, unable to be outsmarted or outmatched.",

The desperate mind flayers and elder brain from the crashed nautiloid assaulted the kraken from the remains of their ship. Many of the remaining Illithid were killed by the ancient beast, but a huge scale psionic attack from the mind flayers probed into Slarkrethel’s psychic ability, temporarily subduing him. Realising time was short, the few Illithid that remained grafted the elder brain pool of Zellix’Phor into the skull of Slarkrethel. With their unmatched knowledge of bioconstruction, the Illithid physically attached Zellix’Phor to Slarkrethel’s brainstem, and the two super intellects merged in an otherworldly fashion. Slarkrethel’s personality is entirely suppressed by Zellix’Phor, who managed to assimilate the kraken’s memories. The perversion of nature that remains is an incredibly potent psionic mastermind.",

What happens to these groups is up to the DM, but Slarkrethel’s followers are unlikely to be able to reintegrate into society once their psychic master is destroyed. The characters might even face the wrath of {@deity Umberlee|Faerûnian|scag} in full, as the very oceans turn against them.",

When a ship takes the {@action Attack} action, assume that it uses all its weapons so long as there are enough crew to use them (remembering that some weapons take multiple action to use). Taking the {@action Dash} action allows a ship to move twice as fast as it normally would, but may require a successful Strength check at the DMs discretion. A ship that {@action Dodge|phb|Dodges} is assumed to be manoeuvred in such a way as to make it harder to hit.",
								"At times, the ship may have to make ability checks or saving throws, for example, to avoid a collision with rocks or an enemy vessel, or perhaps to avoid rocks whilst {@action Dash|phb|Dashing}. Like initiative, refer to the average bonus of the crew.",

By the time Dhurge was fully grown, he has discovered more wands than his hands could carry and had mastered their use. The arcane casting didn't go down well with the sahuagin of Kressilacc, Dhurge's home, so he headed south to the Nelanthers where he knew he could find work as a pirate. Here he was approached by Sea King Tentrix, who recruited him into the Black Armada.",
