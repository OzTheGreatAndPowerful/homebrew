						"We ended up making two books. Before {@book Flee, Mortals! The MCDM Monster Book|FleeMortals} even launched on Kickstarter, we knew that hitting our lairs stretch goal might mean another book's worth of content. When {@book Flee, Mortals!|FleeMortals} reached the layout stage, we realized that our fateful prediction was correct. We could either cut fifty pages of content from the lairs and other parts of {@book Flee, Mortals!|FleeMortals}, or we could break out the lairs into their own book, add more content, and bring our dream book of dungeons and boss battles to life. Since you're reading this, you know which route we took.",
						"The truth is that these lairs deserve to be in their own book. Each little slice of hell contains story hooks, background information, detailed hazards and NPCs, a villain, unique rewards, and all the stat blocks you need to run them. You can use this book without ever referencing {@book Flee, Mortals!|FleeMortals}",
						"The real stars of this book are the villains. Each is abominable in their own way; every lair boss is a unique monster, from their personality to their stat block. When a group of heroes invades a villain's home, that evildoer fights like hell to end the threat. We've given each villain the beefy, playtested stat block they need to stand up to even the most optimized parties.",
						"Each lair was specially crafted for the villain and their allies. A lair is an extension and example of its villain's power and personality. {@creature Lord Syuul|WhereEvilLives} performs his wicked experiments in a laboratory made of flesh. {@creature Kiona the Dread Lord|WhereEvilLives} obsessively researches the {@item Codex Mortis|SaF} in her extradimensional library. The once-proud {@creature Ithu'rath|WhereEvilLives} plots their grand return to the top in a crumbling castle.",
						"The boss battles and lairs in this book have saved my game nights. If I don't have anything prepared or if the players zig when I expect them to zag, I can easily grab a story hook or tempt them with some unique treasure and get them into one of these places where evil (and fun!) lives. When I'm scheming for the perfect capstone encounter to end a killer adventure, I reach for this book.",
						"The authors packed so much delicious evil into these bosses and their homes. I am incredibly grateful to them as well as all the artists, consultants, editors, playtesters, and the rest of the MCDM team who worked super hard to make more pages of content in one year than we ever have before. We, uh, learned a lot\u2014a whole friggin' lot.",
						"We hope you enjoy reading and running these lairs as much as we enjoyed making them. Go, brave adventurers. Only you have the heart to face evil where it lives.",
