					"Ratters are a miniscule, rodent-like people that live in groups called infestations, often inhabiting the sewers beneath heavily populated cities. Their metabolisms are just as quick as their minds, creating a ravenous hunger in most ratters for both food and knowledge. This curiosity and peckishness combined with their flexible bodies means that if there's a place a ratter shouldn't be, they probably found a way to get in.",

Their fur comes in a variety of understated colors such as grey, black, brown, white, or any combination thereof. This fur is long and fluffy when clean, but will often appear matted, unkempt, or even spiky due to a lack of grooming habits and a tendency to live in filth.",
							"The bushiness of their fur belies the lithe bodies underneath. Ratters are deceptively slim and highly flexible, with loose joints that allow them to squeeze into seemingly impossible gaps. They also have broad, pointed claws on the tips of their fingers and toes, which are ideal for climbing or burrowing in soft earth. Lightweight, flexible, and capable of slipping or scraping through tight spaces, ratters have little trouble infiltrating food stores and getting into other places they aren't wanted."

							"As intelligent creatures, ratters are acutely aware of just how short their twenty-year lifespans are as compared to those of other humanoids. Ratters despise wasting time. They speak quickly, think quickly, and take action quickly, without dwelling on the consequences or any other “wasteful” thoughts. They take offense, often violently, to any action or custom they deem to be a waste of their time, such as smalltalk, waiting in lines, or dealing with bureaucracy; ratters will usually put their quick minds to work finding a creative way around such pointless obstructions.",
							"Most organized societies consider ratters to be loathsome pests and will go to great lengths to keep an infestation out of their sewers. For their part, ratters harbor a much more powerful dislike, and sometimes even hatred, of these longer-lived races; they're viciously jealous of creatures with greater lifespans, especially elves. Compared to other races that seem to have all the time in the world, ratters find it incredibly unfair to have been given so little time.",
							"A ratter's short life also sparks within them a fundamental desire to continue to have an impact after they're gone, to leave a legacy behind. While many ratters believe their legacies are completed simply by surviving to continue their lines, others are dissatisfied at the idea of using their limited time only for the purpose or procreation. These ratters yearn to accomplish greater feats, and some, seeking something new they can contribute to their infestations, turn their minds to gaining and utilizing knowledge. Painfully aware of how limited their time is, these scholarly ratters blaze through texts and tomes, desperate to discover some lost lore such as the secret to attaining immortality, or to find an adventure that will be sung of in taverns across the world — anything that will keep their memory alive throughout the eons."

Quick to form attachments, ratters tend to consider the rats, mice, and other rodents of the sewers to be family, too, often treating them as siblings or beloved pets. Whether this behavior is due to similarity of appearance or of circumstance is unknown, but the attachments formed are fierce, and ratters even develop ways to communicate with their smaller, subterranean fellows.",
							"Unfortunately, the ratters' high birth rates, huge families, and fast metabolisms can quickly combine to cause food shortages within an infestation, eventually forcing the family to the point of desperation. Ratters' terrible hunger, when left unsatisfied for extended periods, begins to drive them mad, until they must either leave the infestation on a blind and perilous search for food, or begin feeding upon each other. Most ratters that survive to reach adulthood bear numerous scars, afflictions, and diseases due to the feeding frenzies they've battled through down in the sewers. Even this violent cycle of starvation and madness cannot break a loyal ratter's family bonds, however. After a frenzy has abated, the remaining members of the infestation quickly make amends, their devotion running deep enough to survive the carnage."

Occasionally, a ratter infestation will be discovered and routed by the authorities of the city that lies atop the infestation's sewer dens, causing much of the family to become separated or slain. And once in a great while, a ratter may be so grievously wounded during a feeding frenzy that their familial bonds snap, causing them to leave the infestation of their own accord.",
							"Ratters hunger for a social group nearly as much as they do for food, and they find it hard to resist the urge to find a replacement for the family they lost. Most often, this is achieved by stumbling onto an adventuring group. Thanks to their capacity for deep familial bonds and their extreme impatience, ratters tend to make themselves into fiercely loyal, if often troublesome, members of these parties.",
							"Though their instincts and physical attributes naturally lead many ratters to become rogues, the more scholarly ratters who pursue knowledge tend to follow the path of wizardry.

				"You create a magical zone in a 60-foot-radius sphere centered on yourself that makes communication between any language-speaking people possible. The sphere doesn't remain with you as you move, instead remaining centered on the space you occupied when you cast it. For the duration, any creature fully within the sphere that speaks at least one language can understand any spoken language it hears. The spell translates the intended meaning of what is spoken, not just the literal meaning."
