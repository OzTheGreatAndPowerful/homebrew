The pain only makes her stronger. As she descends on the snarling pack she swings wildly, knocking several hobgoblins off their feet and sending the rest scattering before her.",

He ducks beneath the orc's wide swing then raises both hands high above his head and brings them down on the orc's back, forcing the brute to the ground.",

The young dandy flinches, stumbles backward, and runs away as the dwarf turns back to the bar to order another round.",

They take offense, often violently, to any action or custom they deem to be a waste of their time, such as smalltalk, waiting in lines, or dealing with bureaucracy; ratters will usually put their quick minds to work finding a creative way around such pointless obstructions.",

These ratters yearn to accomplish greater feats, and some, seeking something new they can contribute to their infestations, turn their minds to gaining and utilizing knowledge. Painfully aware of how limited their time is, these scholarly ratters blaze through texts and tomes, desperate to discover some lost lore such as the secret to attaining immortality, or to find an adventure that will be sung of in taverns across the world — anything that will keep their memory alive throughout the eons."

Whether this behavior is due to similarity of appearance or of circumstance is unknown, but the attachments formed are fierce, and ratters even develop ways to communicate with their smaller, subterranean fellows.",

Most ratters that survive to reach adulthood bear numerous scars, afflictions, and diseases due to the feeding frenzies they've battled through down in the sewers.

				"The Way of Kabuki is not practiced or taught in a stationary monastery, but in traveling theater troupes that seek to delight, awe, and shock audiences with bizarre, over-the-top performances. Monks of this tradition wear gaudy, avante-garde costumes with mask-like face paint, and utilize exaggerated movements and sounds to put on dance-dramas featuring outlandish humor and often ribald scenarios. They use stage names, and many actor monks go through several over the span of their career, reinventing themselves as they see fit, or as offended nobles and politicians demand retribution for perceived insults.",
				"Despite its appearance of irreverence and iconoclasm, the Way of Kabuki is rooted in a long tradition of honor and respect for the art and magic of showmanship and fellow actors. Performer monks too old to continue traveling, or wanting to use a new stage name, take on an apprentice and teach them the art of kabuki, eventually passing their moniker to the young performer in elaborate ceremonies called shumei. This young monk then spends their life continuing the legacy of the name, and eventually passes it to an apprentice of their own.",
