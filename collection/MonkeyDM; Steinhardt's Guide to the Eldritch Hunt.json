								"Welcome to the enthralling domain of {@i Steinhardt's Guide to the Eldritch Hunt}.",
								"Gothic horror, with its tragic tales, haunted mansions, and cursed bloodlines, taps into our deepest fears about our past and the inescapable legacies we might leave behind. Eldritch horror, on the other hand, challenges our understanding of the universe, presenting cosmic entities and phenomena so beyond our comprehension that mere exposure to them can drive a person to madness.",
								"But why introduce these elements into a campaign? The answer lies in the atmosphere and tension they create. While traditional adventures offer excitement, challenges, and epic tales of heroism, adding layers of horror can transform a campaign into a deeply immersive and emotionally charged experience. It's not just about battling monsters; it's about battling one's own fears, confronting the unknown, and facing the darker aspects of the world and oneself.",
								"This book aims to guide Game Masters on a journey into the heart of darkness, providing tools, techniques, and insights to craft a memorable horror-infused campaign. Drawing inspiration from classic literature, iconic horror films, and the lore of {@i Steinhardt's Guide to the Eldritch Hunt}, we'll delve deep into the mechanics of fear, the nuances of narrative tension, and the art of creating a truly haunting atmosphere.",
								"So, gather your courage, light a candle, and prepare to step into a world where every corner holds a mystery, every shadow might conceal a threat, and every decision can mean the difference between sanity and madness."

Though subtle, it is perhaps the most important fear on this list. Movies can get away with cheap jumpscares to get a fight-or-flight response out of their audience, but we can't.",
												"Unease is the whisper of the wind through a broken window, the distant howl of a wolf, or the fleeting glimpse of a figure in the periphery of your vision.
