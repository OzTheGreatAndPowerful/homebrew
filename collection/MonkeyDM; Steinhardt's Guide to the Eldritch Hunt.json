										"Half a millennium past, Luyarnha was nothing but a humble settlement. Sprouted from a tentative alliance of humans and elves, it was a unique circumstance in an era of separation and discord.",
										"For a time, the land on which it lay was a battleground, a coveted prize for both species. Neither human nor elven armies could claim true victory. Until, from the ashes of ceaseless conflict, rose an idea: united, they could reach heights unattainable alone. And thus, Luyarnha emerged\u2014a sanctuary at the frontier of two worlds. Humanity claimed the east, and the elven empire took the west, their destinies interwoven below the frozen reaches of the north. To the south lay an uncharted wilderness, teeming with untamed, fearsome beasts that deterred even the bravest of explorers.",
										"This exchange of ideas proved to be incredibly positive. Elven sagacity was fused with human tenacity; the wisdom of long-lived beings blended with the vigorous dynamism of mankind, launching Luyarnha into an era of prosperity. Where elves had the sharpness necessary to make competent decisions, humans' capability to reproduce, superior physical strength, and inherent drive to succeed made them prime explorers and laborers, capable of throwing bodies at a problem until it was solved.",
										"Thus the Luyarnhian province brought forth a verdant renaissance of agriculture. Fields bloomed in abundance, providing sustenance aplenty for the burgeoning populace. It was an arrangement symbiotic in nature, a ballet of cooperation.",
										"In this era, Luyarnha, governed by representatives from both races, was bestowed the crown of independence, but it was in name only. The city remained an infant, dependent on the support of its parent kingdoms to bloom into its destined grandeur, still bending to their whims to receive what was necessary for its growth."

										"The nascent town sprouted rapidly, its own distinct identity blossoming from the fertile soil of its mixed heritage. A shared tapestry of traditions and cultures that was neither wholly elven nor human, but uniquely Luyarnhian. A sense of self-rule began to stir in the hearts of its people, kindling a desire for complete autonomy.",
										"And so, the negotiation for independence unfurled. The strategic position of the town, nestled between the two colossal empires, forestalled any attempt at invasion from either side. Eventually, Luyarnha emerged victorious in its negotiation, its sovereignty acknowledged by the birth of a new regent appointed by both sides: the Silverblood baron\u2014a half-elf that shared both the elven and human roots of the town. Though this title was but a symbolic veneer, it served to establish Luyarnha as a sovereign city-state in the eyes of its inhabitants.",
										"The journey was not without turbulence. Conflicts erupted, dissenters voiced their grievances, but the success of the venture drowned out the noise. The richness of a shared culture, a unity of purpose, catapulted Luyarnha into an epoch of unparalleled wealth. Nestled at the crossroads of naval and terrestrial trade routes, it burgeoned into a bustling hub of commerce and prosperity."

								"Several decades of tranquility blessed the city-state of Luyarnha, nestled as it was within the protective embrace of two formidable empires. Each kingdom had its fate intertwined with the city, leading to a vested interest in preserving its prosperity. And so, the city-state blossomed, its roots deepening in the fertile soil of commerce, trading expansively with its neighbors and within its own borders. However, the southern frontier posed a constant threat, its hostile ambitions resulting in numerous bids to conquer Luyarnha. This imminent danger birthed a mighty southern wall, which in time evolved into a fortress encircling the city-state.",

										"Yet, amid this progress, an unforeseen issue began to rear its ugly head. Luyarnha's charm lay in its cultural diversity, a wealth of varied belief systems cohabiting within its borders, diversity that was further amplified by the arrivals of orcs and their traditions. However, this vibrancy soon turned into a curse. Tensions simmered, clashes occurred, and tribes formed within the city, each viewing the other through lenses of suspicion. This tribalization stalled Luyarnha's growth and influenced all spheres of life, including the justice system.",
										"Within the city's courtrooms, the cultural dissonance became glaringly obvious. Diverse perspectives on justice clashed relentlessly. The more austere cultures clamored for capital punishment for certain crimes, while others advocated for redemption and forgiveness. Reaching a consensus seemed an insurmountable task, leading to each 'tribe' taking matters into their own hands and deciding their own form of justice.",
										"Such discord was the antithesis of unity. The fractures within Luyarnha's society grew deeper, with the once unified nation showing signs of fragmentation. The Silverblood queen of the time, in an effort to quell the unrest, sought to weave a cultural fabric that could embrace the myriad hues of its people. Alas, the threads snapped, and the initiative fell flat. The attempt to impose a homogenous culture on a city of diverse traditions and beliefs proved futile."

										"In the midst of such tumult, a fresh heir emerged from the revered Silverblood lineage. Upon his mother's demise, he ascended the throne, inheriting the title of the King of Luyarnha. This young ruler, Reinholdt \"The Yellow\" Silverblood\u2014always adorned in his family's yellow garb\u2014remained indifferent to the moral dilemmas plaguing his subjects. He envisioned a singular path towards unity and was willing to pay the high price it demanded; he worked relentlessly to achieve this goal throughout the 66 years of his reign.",
										"Reinholdt embarked on his reign by centralizing laws, consolidating military power, and dealing sternly with any who sought to undermine his authority. This increasing concentration of power was leveraged for personal gain, akin to feudal practices, and many were concerned by his decisions. He perceived these as necessary sacrifices for the attainment of his grand future.",
										"As the government grew more centralized, it executed a radical plan\u2014banning all religions within the state\u2014 earning Reinholdt the moniker of Godless King. Thus began a period of ruthless prosecution of those who held on to their 'worthless gods'. Simultaneously, a vast indoctrination program was set into motion, imposing upon citizens the learning of songs and propaganda glorifying the government. These were mandated across all educational institutions and public spaces. This shift from a religiously diverse society to a godless one was expedited due to the dwindling display of divine power. The ancient tales of gods and their miracles paled in comparison to the modern advancements brought forth by mortals. All of Luyarnha was to bend the knee to the Silverblood rule, lest it be met with a red wave of blood.",
										"Convinced by his own propaganda, the Godless King began to perceive himself as a god\u2014he who was driven by grand visions and possessed the voice of creation. It seemed only righteous, then, for him to make decisions that would sculpt the nation's future. He declared himself the only God worthy of worship, outlawing all other religions. In his pursuit of unity, he imprisoned and executed thousands, targeting believers and political adversaries alike. The diverse cultural landscape was crushed beneath the weight of the state, and Luyarnha was brought under the singular banner of the Godless King, invoking both fear and reverence. Days were dedicated to his worship, songs composed in his honor, and history books were revised to glorify his reign. However, he harbored an appreciation for religious architecture, and spared most religious structures, as they were a source of pride for the city.",
										"The Godless King nurtured ambitions of global dominance for his lineage. He diverted substantial resources towards military development and weaponry, whilst systematically eradicating beliefs in anything other than the state. During his reign, Luyarnha's military prowess saw a significant boost, particularly as the Elven Enclave in the west grappled with its internal conflicts. Seeing an opportunity, he instituted a compulsory draft to amplify Luyarnha's military, establishing extensive military infrastructure and compelling the populace to serve, with the threat of incarceration looming over dissenters. This coercive measure soon became routine, leading to a mostly voluntary military force.",
										"Concurrently, the human empire was obliterated, seemingly overnight, leaving only ashes in its wake and no survivors to explain the sudden vanishing of an entire nation. Fearful of the fate that befell the humans\u2014and perhaps aware of the cause of their fate\u2014the Godless King rerouted most of the country's finances towards plans of war. As the Elven Enclave weakened and internal conflicts rose, the Godless King, apprehensive that the force that annihilated the humans might turn towards him, hastened his invasion plans. This fear, however, was to prove his undoing."

										"In a grave miscalculation, the Godless King's public proclamation of his intent to conquer the Elven Enclave, ill-mixed with the grievous mishandling of the public's perception, kindled the spark of dissent that marked the onset of his downfall.",
										"The people of Luyarnha bore the suffering under the regime, lured by the allure of a brighter future. Yet, the moment they realized this future was founded on the impending subjugation of the elven realm, a realm many still held in high regard due to shared ancestry, resentment began to seep in. Elves, after all, are the keepers of deep-rooted memories, and the state's recent\u2014by elven reckoning\u2014propagandistic endeavors could not extinguish these ties. The fact that Luyarnha was a city more accustomed to the clatter of trade than the clang of swords further intensified the resistance against sending their offspring to a war that wasn't theirs to fight. This sentiment resonated most profoundly amongst the orcish populace who had watched too many of their kin fall in the clan wars of old, before finding refuge within Luyarnha's walls.",
										"This led to civil unrest, which was furthered by the Radiant Church; what was once a niche sect was given room to proliferate when all other religions had to bend the knee. Indeed, followers of the Radiant One stood strong in their belief and would keep showing faith even on the gallows. Such conviction moved many to join their cause. Thus, many military leaders\u2014those who were charged with maintaining the peace\u2014began to turn their back on the aristocracy, driven not only by newfound faith, but also by the tantalizing allure of the Church's promises of riches and prosperity.",
										"This tension ignited a bloody and brutal civil war.",
										"The civil war tore through the city for months on end, cleaving through the once resplendent Spired District. The arcane arts, a rare and coveted gift that coursed through the veins of the king and those of his blood, were ruthlessly wielded. During this violent strife, the citizens were introduced to the dark arts of osteomancy\u2014a malevolent and hitherto unseen magic. Yet, adversity is the mother of invention, and the now powerful Radiant Church found ways to counter these arcane horrors. As the conflict wore on, it became evident that the revolutionary forces would emerge triumphant, the populace rallying to their cause and the once-dreaded royal magic proving unsuccessful against the Church and its adherents.",
										"In the final throes of the civil war, the Church laid siege to the Silverbloods, holed up in their castle and bracing for a last stand they knew they couldn't win. However, unbeknownst to them, betrayal was brewing within their own ranks; the king's brother, in a desperate pact with the Church, agreed to assassinate the king in return for the survival and salvaged prestige of the Silverblood lineage. He carried out his dark promise, plunging a dagger into his brother's heart before the aghast eyes of the revolutionary crowd. The Radiant Church upheld their end of the pact, sparing the remainder of the Silverblood family.",
										"Those who were present during the Godless King's murder heard him talk in an impossible language, laying a curse upon Luyarnha with his last breath. None is sure of what this posthumous act of spite entailed, though some speculate that his objective was to bring ruin upon the city he once ruled, a punishment to the people who betrayed him, in the form of the Scourge.",
										"In the aftermath, chaos swept over Luyarnha. With no clear political path forward, the nation found itself in disarray. The Church assumed an interim governance role, overtaking the Grand Cathedral District, while the surviving Silverbloods, under the watchful eyes of their new overseers, were reluctantly enlisted to aid in restoring order."

										"News of Luyarnha's vulnerability reached the monstrous nations of the south, who deemed this the opportune moment to strike. Thus, under the sky of a crimson moon, the First War dawned on the city-state.",
										"When the bells of war began to toll, emissaries were sent to the neighboring countries requesting help, in vain. The once majestic human empire was nothing but ash; meanwhile, the Elven Enclave was consumed by its own internal struggles, unable to spare a thought or soldier for the unfolding tragedy to their east.",
										"Yet, amidst these dire odds, the southern wall of the city, built years prior to protect against the seasonal bestial incursions, was now the core of its defense and survival, holding strong against the southern marauders. Though a handful of the vile beasts breached this bulwark, the vast majority of the war's horrors unfolded outside the city's margins.",
										"It was a ballet of death and despair, yet Luyarnha, due to its entrenched position and fortified defenses, seemed to dance with a grace that surprised even the citizens. The city was holding its own, emerging victorious in the initial skirmishes of the war. Further bolstering this surprising resistance were the unexpected allies\u2014the cursed-bloods and the dwarves\u2014who stepped forth as the drums of war began to beat. The cursed-bloods, outcasts yet invaluable, showcased masonry skills that bordered on the divine. Without their tireless efforts in preserving and reinforcing the city walls, Luyarnha would have crumbled under the onslaught within months, a story most tend to forget.",
										"Thus, in the face of mounting odds, Luyarnha was able to weather the early stages of the First War, owing to the fortitude of its inhabitants and the unsung heroes who lent their hands to the city's survival."

										"The wheel of war churned mercilessly, and the scene in Luyarnha darkened. The enemy changed its tactics; it tasked guerilla forces shrouded in veils of illusion to utilize the chaos sowed by their savage beasts as a smokescreen and infiltrate the city. They melded into the population, masquerading as everyday citizens. The bestial southerners, wolves in sheep's clothing, bared their fangs only once within the heart of the city, spreading terror and bloodshed in equal measure. And so, Luyarnha found itself ensnared in a conflict of two fronts\u2014one beyond its sturdy walls, the other festering within its very heart.",
										"The city-state, overwhelmed by this maelstrom of violence and betrayal, strained under the burden. Holding off the monstrous hordes from the south was a colossal task unto itself. Combating an insidious foe within, a task far more daunting. Such was the cunning of the southern forces.",
										"Before this daunting reality, the Radiant Church unshackled the Obitus Scholare\u2014a specialized task force born amidst the flames of the civil war\u2014from all moral and legal obligations. Once formed to counter the arcane might of the fallen royalty, they were now consigned the task of forging human weapons that could quell the storm of the First War. As soon as hostilities erupted, the Obitus were handed all research artifacts and arcane knowledge previously hoarded by the fallen Silverblood royalty. Alongside them, another group of learned individuals emerged from the city's desperate cries for salvation\u2014the Scions. Both factions, standing to gain from the war's grim bounty, crafted tools of destruction that would enable Luyarnha to retaliate.",
										"The war continued its dreadful dance, a merciless juggernaut that trampled and erased the villages encircling Luyarnha, leaving trails of ruin in its wake. One such settlement was cruelly drowned in a flood of corrosive acid\u2014a despicable act of cruelty by the southern invaders. The battlefield was awash with death and despair, and Luyarnha and its wall were on the brink of succumbing. Just as hope appeared to wane, the Obitus Scholare heralded a breakthrough.",

										"Their magnum opus, the first jaeger, an augmented warrior equipped with superhuman capabilities and tracking prowess, was unveiled. This warrior could not only root out the infiltrators within the city, but also slay the beasts that accompanied them, quickly neutralizing the inside threat. The original jaeger was none other than Steinhardt, the second offspring of the Godless King. Steinhardt, an enigmatic figure hitherto unseen by the populace, stepped forth from the shadows to become a beacon of hope. Following Steinhardt's emergence, a new breed of jaegers trained by the Obitus and the Church began to turn the tide against the invaders. To this day, jaegers born of the First War are called the First Jaegers, and to this day, no one but the Obitus knows the secret behind the jaeger's creation; many were once boys, turned into men by the blood, the old blood shed in the war.",
										"Parallel to this, the Scions had their moment under the limelight, presenting a wonder of artificial life\u2014the Manikins. These sentient robotic entities offered Luyarnha much-needed reinforcements, another layer of defense against the encroaching southern tide.",
										"These technological leaps turned the tables on the southerners. Their guerrilla tactics were rendered moot, and the city's walls, which they had once come so close to breaching, now stood as an unyielding barrier. With Luyarnha's infrastructure revamped by the Godless King, the city-state was entirely self-sufficient, untroubled by severed trade routes. On the contrary, it was the southerners who faced the grim specter of dwindling rations and ammunition. Their encampment close to the city's walls merely served as an inviting target for Luyarnha's cannons. After enduring years of conflict, the southerners sounded their retreat, surrendering Luyarnha its victory.",
										"Yet in the wake of this conflict, there was no glory to bask in, no joy to revel in. What remained was a graveyard of brave hearts and broken dreams, and a fragile peace that hung in the balance. Or so everyone dared to hope."

										"The citizens, having found solace in the Church's dedication and faith, resolved to entrust them with the reins of power, at least for the time being, amidst the political void left by the Silverblood royalty's downfall.",
										"Despite their diminished status, the Silverblood, fortified by Steinhardt's sweeping popularity, clung to their place within the power structure. A new queen ascended, her influence severely diminished, yet the Church acknowledged the strategic boon of her family's wisdom during the war. Therefore, a degree of political power was granted, albeit grudgingly.",
										"The once grand Spired District, now a ruin, was resurrected from its ashes and rechristened as the New Bridge District. The Scions, tasked with orchestrating the mammoth repair efforts, deemed it an ideal location for their operations. Pouring vast resources into the restoration, they harnessed the abilities of their Manikin creations to expedite the process.",
										"The Obitus Scholare relocated to the confines of the Grand Cathedral District, sharing its hallowed grounds with the Church's executive functions. Here, they were entrusted with significant funds to further research initiatives intended to uplift the populace\u2014a vision the Radiant Church eagerly fostered.",
										"With its newfound political ascendancy, the Church found the ground fertile for spreading their doctrines, both within and beyond their city's boundaries. A major portion of Luyarnha's populace began gravitating towards their faith, and trade routes were flung open to neighboring and distant nations, even those far beyond the purview of the human and elven empires. This era heralded the introduction of novel technologies like railways, forging connections where none existed before.",
										"Commerce burgeoned anew, welcoming fresh faces into the Radiant city and birthing vast fortunes. Yet, memories of past invasions lingered like persistent shadows. The city's protective wall was reinforced with layers of unyielding stone and steel, an indomitable testament to Luyarnha's resolve, and a silent warning to any daring to threaten its peace.",
										"Conversely, this period of growth marked the dwindling of the arcane. While magic was always an elusive commodity, the rapid technological strides\u2014tools within everyone's grasp\u2014pushed arcane research to the periphery. Particularly as technology doesn't possess the harrowing aftermath of the arcane, especially evident with osteomancy. In the event known as the Great Unchaining, this accursed magic unleashed its malevolent wrath on its very practitioners. Many scholarly lives were extinguished in its unforgiving grasp, necessitating the Church to mobilize its martial might to exterminate the monstrous horrors spawned by this cataclysm."

Whispers of grotesque beasts prowling the city's cobbled paths started stirring the air, hushed by the voices and fearful gazes of citizens dreading the return of the southern armies. However, these creatures seemed to be phantoms of the night, leaving no evidence of their existence come morning light.",
										"At first, the Church and its delegates staunchly dismissed such monstrous sightings, successfully easing the citizens' simmering panic. But as time passed, tales of nocturnal horrors multiplied. With each new day, the ghastly evidence mounted\u2014a lifeless body discovered at dawn, trails of crimson on cobblestones, and even citizens vanishing without a trace.",
										"As the public outcry grew, the Church's initial denial took on a stricter tenor. No longer were citizens allowed to venture out at nightfall as the threat began to reveal its terrifying reality. Instead, the Church dispatched its trained hunters into the night to combat these unseen beasts, while ordinary citizens were forced to seek refuge behind locked doors.",

Yet, despite their warriors' valiant efforts, fresh monstrosities seemed to emerge each night. Recognizing the gravity of the situation, the Church officially acknowledged the growing menace, now dubbed the Scourge. Citizens willing to fight were recruited to protect their loved ones and their city. The sealing of the Ruby District happened after a Blood Moon, particularly after the 33rd Hunt\u2014the Church calls these crimson moons Hunts, shifting the emphasis to the hunters prepared rather than the beasts to come\u2014where the beasts were animated with vicious frenzy and countless hunters were lost; the Ruby District that was teetering on the edge was completely lost that night.",
										"But the containment efforts fell short as the Scourge began to seep into other parts of the city. The looming external threats from neighboring nations forced the Church's hand into placing the entire city under lockdown. Outside countries warned that if the Scourge wasn't quelled, they would unite to erase Luyarnha from existence. All politicians, burdened by the memory of fighting on multiple fronts in the First War, knew full well that fighting on multiple fronts would mean the end of the city-state, and conceded to their demands."

Once, these celestial oscillations were a secret known only to the intellectuals, a knowledge invaluable for predicting the ominous rise of the Blood Moons. Yet in recent times, the entire city has become privy to this terrifying spectacle, the silent dread of the cosmos etched on every face that dares look up at the inky sky.",

Fear has become a constant companion in the shadowed corners and narrow alleyways of Luyarnha.",

Whispers of dread and foreboding seep through the city, tales of the coming of an eternal night, when all light will be swallowed, and no spark of radiance will remain to guide them.",
										"Despite the encroaching darkness, Luyarnha continues its grim struggle for survival. The Scourge's malign influence is most potent in the Ruby District, but even beyond its boundaries, the city's defenses are starting to crumble under the relentless assault. On the edge of oblivion, Luyarnha perseveres, clenching its teeth against the onslaught, a city besieged, yearning for a day of respite and peace."

						"The birth of the Radiant Faith was sparked by divine revelations from the Prophet Luminara, foretelling the forthcoming Radiant Ascendancy\u2014a time when the Radiant One's glow would illuminate the world. From its humble beginnings as a seed of faith in the hearts of a select few, it flourished into a spiritual canopy that now stretches over the entirety of Luyarnha.",

								"The Radiant Church's faith holds two fundamental tenets that are integral to their belief. The first is a conviction that true goodness is inextricably linked to strength. Weakness is seen as a vice, a craven display of cowardice rather than a virtue to be upheld. The Radiant clergy expect their followers to be brave, to stand tall in the face of adversity, and to be a beacon of strength for those around them.",
								"This belief in strength is grounded in the understanding that those who are weak act out of fear, rather than a genuine desire to do good. This is not to say that acts of kindness are without merit, but the Radiant Church asserts that the only true benevolence comes from a place of fortitude and resilience. It is a difficult yet powerful philosophy that has led the church to many victories in the past. Leading by example, many of the major figures within the church stand out as giants amongst their fellow citizens, capable of impressive physical displays of power.",
								"The second core belief of the Radiant Church is one of hope for the future. They hold firm to the idea that despite the trials and tribulations of the present, a bright and prosperous tomorrow is within reach. They recognize the immense progress that has been made over the centuries; their lives are far more advanced than their forebears could have ever dreamed. It is the church's duty to ensure continued prosperity, and devout followers are confident that they are the vanguard of a brighter future. Their faith and devotion ensure that progress continues in the years to come, and that none lose the light of hope throughout the world.",

										"Not all the ideas within the Radiant Church are original to them. One such powerful belief that permeates the church is the concept of heaven and hell. Many other religions share these ideas of a guardian at the gate, who upon death determines if ones life was worthy enough to ascend to the higher planes, or if one should descend to the foul planes for an eternity of torture.",
										"The Radiant Faith shares these beliefs, holding to the idea that we are all birthed with light and darkness in our soul, and depending on the deeds we perform, this light shines brighter or darker. The choices we make can either fuel the light or feed the darkness within us. But this principle extends beyond individuals; it's believed that the collective sins of many can push the world towards heaven or hell. With the Scourge currently ravaging the city, there's a growing fear that it's an omen of the city plunging towards hell's icy grasp.",
										"This duality seems embodied within the religion, as all the most righteous saints of the Radiant Church possess eyes of gold. Conversely, those who commit the foulest of sins do not possess darkened eyes, probably due to the fact that once one begins a road filled with sins, the Radiant Faith seems unimportant and is quickly abandoned. Though if one is to meet an individual of darkened iris and sclera, they know better than to approach too close, as sin darkens their heart. Cursed-bloods know of this hatred far too well\u2014they who possess obsidian eyes."

								"In ages past, decades after the city-state of Luyarnha was crowned with sovereignty, a decline in religious worship began to take root. The ruling class, in their hubris, declared the veneration of the divine to be illegal and mandated the substitution of the sacred with a series of ceremonies praising their leader and their flawless government. This edict was inculcated in each household and each school so that none would entertain dangerous ideas. Further compounding this abandonment of faith was the crowning of the Godless King, a man who perceived religion to be a mere distraction for the masses, incompatible with his vision of the future; the state was perfect and eternal, and no mere god would alter that.",
								"In the campaign to eradicate religious worship from the city, most gods\u2014beings who derived their power through veneration from mortals\u2014were abandoned and forgotten. Yet, amidst this destruction of faith, a budding light refused to die, the Radiant Faith, proudly held up by the hearts of many devout souls who couldn't abandon hope. Initially, many dismissed them as yet another group destined to be crushed under the weight of the state doctrine. How wrong they were.",
								"In these years of struggle, Luminara, the faith's leader, faced public execution at the hands of the Godless King himself. Brutally eviscerated, his innards splayed and nailed to the four corners, Luminara was left to die. However, during this savage spectacle, Luminara did not plead nor scream, but prayed to his god for forgiveness. When the King completed his grotesque performance, Luminara wept not for himself, but for the corrupted heart of the King, pitying him even in the face of death\u2014an act that sent the ruler into a bestial frenzy. This public act of defiance bolstered the faith, elevating Luminara to martyrdom and sainthood, and he henceforth became known as the Luminary Prophet. The symbol of his sacrifice, the Innarda, became the emblem for the Radiant Faith.",
								"Three days following his cruel demise, disciples of the Luminary Prophet bore witness to visions of him, radiant with heavenly luminescence, proclaiming his transcendence to a higher existence. These spectral visitations stoked the faith with renewed purpose and zeal, marking the commencement of the Radiant Ascendancy. In this ascendance, believers saw the Luminary Prophet transformed into a divine conduit for their eternal lord, the Radiant One. This was the beacon of hope they had prayed for, here to cast away the age of darkness.",

										"News of their good deeds rapidly spread, and soon most of the city's lower districts were erecting churches and cathedrals to worship the Radiant One in obstinate defiance of the ruling class, for as the power of the Church grew, faith in the state and its benevolence began to erode. The tension between the two camps mounted, fueled by the ruling class's treatment of the citizenry, their rapaciousness, and their pretentious ceremonies. The conflict culminated in a civil war that the nobility lost, forcing them to kneel as the military forces, abject moralists, and resentful subjects that supported them were slowly supplanted by a more hopeful kin that rejected their tyranny. They were thus compelled to surrender before any further bloodshed could ensue. On that day\u2014 called the Day of Deliverance\u2014the Godless King's heart was stabbed from behind, his body then unceremoniously cast to the populace to do as they wished with the tyrant's remains. What remained of the body was later recovered and buried beneath the castle. In the resulting power vacuum, the Radiant Church arose to dictate the future of the state."

Despite the growing evidence of this corruption, the church leadership turned a blind eye, choosing to prioritize its reputation and influence over the purity of its message, attempting to maintain the hegemony of the city. Perhaps it was pride, or simply a refusal to admit the truth, but their noble ideals were soon tarnished, leading to internal conflicts and divisions within the church."

But since their fall from grace and the Godless King, they have lost the ability to make such judgements. Instead, nobles have opted to use their funds to develop increasingly more powerful weapons, ones that would be too dangerous to be distributed widely among the populace, as a single person with the wrong mindset accessing them would signal doom for all. In response, the Church, well aware that many within the nobility have a corrupted mindset, developed jaegers and other human weapons.

								"Born amidst the civil war, the Obitus Scholare is a respected cog within the intricate machinery of the Radiant Church, toiling diligently within the shadowed halls of the Grand Cathedral to forge new tools and technologies for the betterment of life in Luyarnha and for its defense. Its efforts were initially funded by the church and later by the aristocracy as the First War swept over the city, the urgency of conflict adding fuel to the fires of innovation. Yet, the insatiable hunger for power that danced within its scholars' eyes gradually began to lead them down the path of sacrilege and blasphemy.",
								"Their research bore fruit of the most forbidden kind, unveiling what they thought to be the eldritch lineage of their deity, an abhorrent revelation they gleaned from the very entrails of the earth itself. Drunken by the intoxicating whispers of this newfound power, the Obitus Scholare freed itself from its allegiance to the Radiant Church, though it still offers a public facade of loyalty.",
								"It has since become a rogue entity, a clandestine assembly working towards what its members perceived to be the true aims of the Radiant One, decrees interpreted through fevered visions. The Radiant Church is built on the virtue of strength and hope for the future, but so too is the Obitus Scholare, which aspires to build its version of a better future\u2014\"mortals are frail and weak, and only through ascension can they be saved\". Justifying the ends through the means, the Obitus Scholare has plunged into an abyss of inhuman experiments, its moral compass broken by the incessant drumbeat of progress.",

Its pursuit gained extraordinary momentum when the Silverblood royalty fell under the Radiant Church's sway. As a grand gift, the church entrusted the Obitus Scholare with the Silverbloods' trove of arcane texts and relics. This archive, amassed meticulously by the family\u2014and notably the Godless King before his demise\u2014was an intricate labyrinth of cursed artifacts and dusty tomes, each potentially hiding a myriad of unique secrets.",

										"Among these cryptic documents, a few members discovered mentions of an ancient ritual site hidden beneath the very roots of Luyarnha. Employing their base, the Asylum, as the entrance to this subterranean secret, they ventured into the bowels of the earth, guided by the arcane inscriptions and the haunting visions that seized their minds. Here, in this clandestine world, they erected a now-forgotten temple, a hallowed ground where they claimed communion with what they believed to be the true Radiant One, a cosmic being that bestowed enlightenment upon them. There, a new, heretical version of the Radiant Faith sprouted in the heart of the Obitus Scholare.",
										"This encounter heralded an era of grand flourishing, as the enlightened Obitus birthed a plethora of creations to alleviate Luyarnha's suffering. Its repertoire of inventions ranged from the reviled hounds assisting hunters, to formidable weapons for combating the armies of the South, to the virtuosic blood archers and the failed living nightmares, to their most astounding achievement, the jaegers\u2014enhanced warriors that tower as demi-gods over ordinary mortals. The Obitus also claimed the discovery of the Holy Tonic, a miraculous brew whose recipe remains a jealously guarded secret.",
										"Their thirst for knowledge led the members of the Obitus down a morally abhorrent path, the chilling hallways of their laboratories bearing witness to a litany of macabre experiments. They explored the frontiers of infection and cure, conducted transplants between disparate creatures, and harvested the cerebro-spinal fluid of Great Ones to infuse into various apparatuses. More profoundly, to commune with the cosmos, they began to employ a neutered form of osteomancy, etching runes into their skulls. The most advanced among them wore golden masks to conceal their fleshless craniums, adorned with an intricate network of runes and eyes, allowing them to gaze into the depths of the cosmos and beckon the moon.",
										"A theory, only held by those privy of the faction's dark actions, suggests that the Scourge was unintentionally\u2014or perhaps intentionally\u2014brought upon the city by the Obitus Scholare. For them, who possess an unending thirst for power, the possibility that they birthed the Scourge during a disastrously misguided experiment is not too far-fetched. Perhaps, in their pursuit of ascension, they inadvertently sparked this plague, their eyes too focused on what lies beyond."

												"One of the first triumphs of the Obitus Scholare's was unraveling the mystifying origins of osteomancy and disseminating this potent knowledge to various magic initiates. This act of democratizing power was designed to keep the nobility in check, preventing their dominance were they to thirst for power anew, and to aid in the fierce conflict against the southern invaders. Indeed, it was successful; the war tilted in their favor, owing in no small part to the force of osteomancy. Yet, a few years hence, a grotesque event referred to as the Great Unchaining unfolded on the triduum of the fourth Hunt. The majority of osteomancy practitioners either suffered a horrific demise or were transfigured into grotesque abominations. In the aftermath, the practice of the magic was promptly banned, its teachings concealed in the deepest vaults, hidden from inquisitive eyes.",
												"This tragic occurrence scarred the reputation of the Obitus Scholare and dealt a damaging blow to its prestige, yet its resolve remained unbroken. By this point, the sect's leadership was fully enmeshed in the faith they had discovered in the god unearthed from the cryptic subterranean chambers, and so they decided to delve deeper. Even in the face of the staggering deaths they had caused, they held steadfast to their thirst for power, well aware that the point of no return was far behind them. Any semblance of remorse was ruthlessly purged from their ranks\u2014many that exhibited such weakness killed themselves, their corpses frequently bearing a bullet hole at the back of the neck\u2014ensuring that the faction's ultimate objectives remained shrouded. To the Church, they wore a facade of unwavering loyalty, whilst in secrecy, they continued their insidious quest.",

The formidable powers they invoked exacted a toll, a vast levy in mortal lives. Initially, their ghastly trials targeted captured giants from the war, for few in Luyarnha harbored qualms about tormenting those who had struck them first. However, the supply of sacrificial lives gradually diminished, and yet, intoxicated by rapid advancements, the Obitus balked at cessation. Its leadership had glimpsed their potential ascendance and would not rest until humanity had elevated to higher spheres of existence; they required more lives for their macabre experimentation."

Despite the triumph, members of the Obitus found no satisfaction; their creations, albeit formidable, were still mere mortals, pitifully feeble in contrast to the divine cosmic shown to them by their god and the great entities from the beyond.",
														"With the cessation of the First War, the Radiant Church, at last free from the burdens of wartime governance, undertook investigations into the birth of the jaegers. Spies were dispatched to probe the depths of the Asylum, and what they discovered was pure horror.",
														"The Obitus Scholare was charged with war crimes in a trial shrouded in secrecy to avoid alerting the awestricken populace, who marveled at the jaegers' strength. The exact details of what the church unearthed and how the Obitus was prosecuted remain shrouded in mystery. The sparse record of the event suggests that only a single, deranged branch of the Obitus had veered into darkness, while the majority of its scholars, in opposition, had created the jaegers through less abhorrent means. Even under the severe trials of the House of Blood, which coerced the truth to surface, none of the jaegers recalled the Asylum or its dreadful experiments. Overwhelming evidence absolved the Obitus, condemning only the branch manager of the Asylum and his subordinates, who were incarcerated within the Abyssal Keep, most meeting their ends therein.",
														"Subsequently, to stifle potential leaks, the Obitus Scholare was relocated and the doors of the infamous Asylum were shuttered forever. Yet many of its scholars yearned for the powers of the Great Ones that their visions had unveiled, a hunger they could not ignore, and in a masterstroke of deception, the Obitus Scholare separated its endeavors.",
														"The Obitus maintained its \"sanitized\" studies within the Observatory, which crowned the Grand Cathedral District and was meant as an open testament to its diligence and righteousness. Meanwhile, the shadowy underbelly of its work was relegated to the Cosmic Seminary, nestled by the tranquil lake that feeds Luyarnha's river and hidden away from prying Church eyes. The Radiant Church, upon rigorous inspections of the Observatory, found their trust in the Obitus renewed, oblivious to the macabre reality\u2014or perhaps willfully blind. Thus, the Obitus Scholare regained the church's favor, even as it persisted in its unspeakable acts behind cloistered walls.",
														"What remains shrouded in darkness, however, is whether the root of the Obitus is so deeply corrupted that every member is compelled to perpetuate malevolence, or if the man who was tried, his name erased from history, managed to cheat death and recommence his dreaded research."

Its sudden assault brought the scholars to the brink of annihilation. The beast did not stop there, as the Cosmic Seminary too fell under its fiery sword just hours later. The precious interval between the attacks granted a few Obitus members just enough time to secrete away their pivotal research artifacts.",

In an agreement with the Radiant Church, their new sanctuary would be cloaked in the deepest shadows, the location concealed even from the eyes of the highest-ranking Church members. The objective was simple: forestall such a cataclysm from recurring. By this time, the Obitus Scholare had become an essential cornerstone of Luyarnha's survival and could not be left unguarded. Thus, its scholars were given unbound liberty to seek out a new clandestine haven for their endeavors.",

Yet a few members were cunning enough to slip away with the crux of their knowledge intact. The Obitus' present location remains shrouded in mystery, although whispers of a sudden flurry of activity in the Asylum have begun to circulate.

But here's the twist that's left the higher ups scratching their heads: when the attendants went to fetch his body for the last rites, they found an empty casket. No trace of the man who was supposed to be inside. It's as if he'd simply... vanished. As if his mortal remains decided to abandon this world ahead of his spirit. Puzzling, unsettling, and utterly inexplicable. I wonder what happened to him.."

This role was recently challenged when shadows of doubt were cast upon the head of the Luminary Scribes. Accusations of personal gain, of altering the rule of law to favor individual pockets over Luyarnha's common good, swirled in like wildfire. The subsequent investigation led to the incarceration of several implicated members, some with connections to the reviled fire dancers, leaving the Church to pray fervently that this blight of corruption had not tainted their ranks any further."

								"Gothic horror, with its tragic tales, haunted mansions, and cursed bloodlines, taps into our deepest fears about our past and the inescapable legacies we might leave behind. Eldritch horror, on the other hand, challenges our understanding of the universe, presenting cosmic entities and phenomena so beyond our comprehension that mere exposure to them can drive a person to madness.",
								"But why introduce these elements into a campaign? The answer lies in the atmosphere and tension they create. While traditional adventures offer excitement, challenges, and epic tales of heroism, adding layers of horror can transform a campaign into a deeply immersive and emotionally charged experience. It's not just about battling monsters; it's about battling one's own fears, confronting the unknown, and facing the darker aspects of the world and oneself.",
								"This book aims to guide Game Masters on a journey into the heart of darkness, providing tools, techniques, and insights to craft a memorable horror-infused campaign. Drawing inspiration from classic literature, iconic horror films, and the lore of {@i Steinhardt's Guide to the Eldritch Hunt}, we'll delve deep into the mechanics of fear, the nuances of narrative tension, and the art of creating a truly haunting atmosphere.",
								"So, gather your courage, light a candle, and prepare to step into a world where every corner holds a mystery, every shadow might conceal a threat, and every decision can mean the difference between sanity and madness."

												"Lovecraftian horror, often referred to as cosmic horror, is a subgenre of horror fiction that emphasizes the cosmic horror of the unknown more than gore or other elements of shock. It is named after American author H.P. Lovecraft, whose work has inspired a vast body of literature and an entire subgenre of horror, emphasizing themes of cosmic dread, forbidden knowledge, the limits of human understanding, and the insignificance of humanity within the vastness of the cosmos.",
												"In Lovecraftian horror, the \"monsters\" aren't just creatures that go bump in the night; they are often indescribable, incomprehensible cosmic entities. These beings embody terrifying truths\u2014that our knowledge and morals mean nothing on a cosmic scale. The horror comes less from physical danger and more from the existential crisis that comes from confronting these entities and the unsettling truths they represent."
