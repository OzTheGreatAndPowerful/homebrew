The memories of others that are aware the characters left or wanted to leave will also be altered to fill the gaps with another plausible event. For example, instead of planning to take a boat to sail away, the characters recall they wanted to use it to go fishing, but got cold feet and decided to go drinking, meet with a lover, or simply get a good night of sleep.",

						"{@i Streets of Terror} is a 5th Edition adventure designed for {@b three to five characters of 2nd to 3rd level} and optimized for {@b four characters with an average party level (APL) of 2}. The characters awaken in a shadowy alley in the city of Luyarnha with no recollection of how they got there. They quickly discover that tonight is Geistnacht\u2014the moon has shattered and released a horde of spirits about to descend upon the city. With no way to escape, the party must fight through the horrors in search of a haven before the streets flow with their blood.",
						"This adventure takes place in the {@i Steinhardt's Guide to the Eldritch Hunt} campaign setting. It utilizes {@book Steinhardt's Madness System|SGttEH|20} {@homebrew |(page 269)} and {@card Shattered Moon|Eldritch Moons Deck|SGttEH} {@homebrew |(page 301)} optional rules. This story can be an introductory adventure to an eldritch campaign in Luyarnha. It introduces the characters to the Radiant Church, the main faction of the city, and slowly builds a sense of dread. The adventure softens the madness mechanics with helpful buffs from the Shattered Moon and can ease the characters into the more oppressive Eldritch Moon effects introduced later.",

In fear of these spectral terrors, the residents barricade their windows and douse their doors with holy water, hiding away and hoping the ghostly horde dissipates with the dawn. Those who survive until morning claim that while the ghosts may be gone, their presence still lingers on every street corner."

								"Since the end of the {@book First War|SGttEH|1|3. The First War} {@homebrew |(page 9)}, the city of Luyarnha has been a shining beacon of civilization, its rulers dedicated to fostering peace, prosperity, and strength for all. Through technological and cultural advances, the city has grown increasingly prosperous. The Radiant Church addresses the spiritual needs of citizens, while the benevolent nobility takes care of their material necessities. The Luyarnhian nobility generously supports the clergy, patronizes the arts and music, and donates their wealth to uplift the poor. It is said that the light itself smiles on Luyarnha.",
								"It takes only a closer look to see the cracks in that shining facade. There is a taint lying beneath the city's surface, a corruption that has rotted its soul. Luyarnhian nobles hide behind false kindness and charity, using the citizens as nothing more than pawns in their twisted machinations. Occult factions of the Radiant Church work in the shadows, experimenting with dark forces beyond their understanding. The city has rotted from the inside through their combined greed and lust for power.",
								"A small sect of the Radiant Church\u2014the Obitus Scholare\u2014recently smuggled the remains of an ancient eldritch creature into the city for experimentation, hiding it in the once-thriving area known as the Ruby District. They discovered a way to augment their bodies, cure diseases, and even extend their lives by alchemically processing the creature's fluids and flesh. A handful of nobles unwittingly funded the secret research to access the sect's eldritch-augmented assassin, oblivious to the grotesque methods being used. And while the nobles gleefully murdered rivals to enrich themselves further, the sect harvested the corpse, developed a tonic they claimed could cure any disease, and gave it to the church healers.",
								"They did not realize the magnitude of the forces at play, nor did they know their assassin was weakening and would betray them. The eldritch being's remains began twisting the fabric of reality, causing the moon to appear on fire and emanating a maddening aura throughout the Ruby District. As the madness flowed through his mind and body, the augmented assassin killed sect members to take the husk's power all for himself.",
								"The resulting sickness spread like wildfire, transforming its victims into twisted creatures filled with rage and madness. In an attempt to impede the propagation of the scourge, the Ruby District, where the infection hit the hardest, was isolated. Citizens now cry for help and accuse the nobility of dabbling in dark arts as the church continues distributing their tonic, unwittingly spreading the madness further. The city's inner rot has finally seeped through the cracks as Luyarnha sinks further into darkness and despair."

The man commits murders\u2014a lot of murders\u2014and each kill leaves an intense feeling of satiation. But suddenly, there is a call from beyond. A distraction from his assigned duty. The eldritch is calling him, and Vargas' blood sings in response. The sweet fluids that drip from its body... Nothing else matters now; he is home."

										"Half a millennium past, Luyarnha was nothing but a humble settlement. Sprouted from a tentative alliance of humans and elves, it was a unique circumstance in an era of separation and discord.",
										"For a time, the land on which it lay was a battleground, a coveted prize for both species. Neither human nor elven armies could claim true victory. Until, from the ashes of ceaseless conflict, rose an idea: united, they could reach heights unattainable alone. And thus, Luyarnha emerged\u2014a sanctuary at the frontier of two worlds. Humanity claimed the east, and the elven empire took the west, their destinies interwoven below the frozen reaches of the north. To the south lay an uncharted wilderness, teeming with untamed, fearsome beasts that deterred even the bravest of explorers.",
										"This exchange of ideas proved to be incredibly positive. Elven sagacity was fused with human tenacity; the wisdom of long-lived beings blended with the vigorous dynamism of mankind, launching Luyarnha into an era of prosperity. Where elves had the sharpness necessary to make competent decisions, humans' capability to reproduce, superior physical strength, and inherent drive to succeed made them prime explorers and laborers, capable of throwing bodies at a problem until it was solved.",
										"Thus the Luyarnhian province brought forth a verdant renaissance of agriculture. Fields bloomed in abundance, providing sustenance aplenty for the burgeoning populace. It was an arrangement symbiotic in nature, a ballet of cooperation.",
										"In this era, Luyarnha, governed by representatives from both races, was bestowed the crown of independence, but it was in name only. The city remained an infant, dependent on the support of its parent kingdoms to bloom into its destined grandeur, still bending to their whims to receive what was necessary for its growth."

										"The nascent town sprouted rapidly, its own distinct identity blossoming from the fertile soil of its mixed heritage. A shared tapestry of traditions and cultures that was neither wholly elven nor human, but uniquely Luyarnhian. A sense of self-rule began to stir in the hearts of its people, kindling a desire for complete autonomy.",
										"And so, the negotiation for independence unfurled. The strategic position of the town, nestled between the two colossal empires, forestalled any attempt at invasion from either side. Eventually, Luyarnha emerged victorious in its negotiation, its sovereignty acknowledged by the birth of a new regent appointed by both sides: the Silverblood baron\u2014a half-elf that shared both the elven and human roots of the town. Though this title was but a symbolic veneer, it served to establish Luyarnha as a sovereign city-state in the eyes of its inhabitants.",
										"The journey was not without turbulence. Conflicts erupted, dissenters voiced their grievances, but the success of the venture drowned out the noise. The richness of a shared culture, a unity of purpose, catapulted Luyarnha into an epoch of unparalleled wealth. Nestled at the crossroads of naval and terrestrial trade routes, it burgeoned into a bustling hub of commerce and prosperity."

								"Several decades of tranquility blessed the city-state of Luyarnha, nestled as it was within the protective embrace of two formidable empires. Each kingdom had its fate intertwined with the city, leading to a vested interest in preserving its prosperity. And so, the city-state blossomed, its roots deepening in the fertile soil of commerce, trading expansively with its neighbors and within its own borders. However, the southern frontier posed a constant threat, its hostile ambitions resulting in numerous bids to conquer Luyarnha. This imminent danger birthed a mighty southern wall, which in time evolved into a fortress encircling the city-state.",

										"Yet, amid this progress, an unforeseen issue began to rear its ugly head. Luyarnha's charm lay in its cultural diversity, a wealth of varied belief systems cohabiting within its borders, diversity that was further amplified by the arrivals of orcs and their traditions. However, this vibrancy soon turned into a curse. Tensions simmered, clashes occurred, and tribes formed within the city, each viewing the other through lenses of suspicion. This tribalization stalled Luyarnha's growth and influenced all spheres of life, including the justice system.",
										"Within the city's courtrooms, the cultural dissonance became glaringly obvious. Diverse perspectives on justice clashed relentlessly. The more austere cultures clamored for capital punishment for certain crimes, while others advocated for redemption and forgiveness. Reaching a consensus seemed an insurmountable task, leading to each 'tribe' taking matters into their own hands and deciding their own form of justice.",
										"Such discord was the antithesis of unity. The fractures within Luyarnha's society grew deeper, with the once unified nation showing signs of fragmentation. The Silverblood queen of the time, in an effort to quell the unrest, sought to weave a cultural fabric that could embrace the myriad hues of its people. Alas, the threads snapped, and the initiative fell flat. The attempt to impose a homogenous culture on a city of diverse traditions and beliefs proved futile."

										"In the midst of such tumult, a fresh heir emerged from the revered Silverblood lineage. Upon his mother's demise, he ascended the throne, inheriting the title of the King of Luyarnha. This young ruler, Reinholdt \"The Yellow\" Silverblood\u2014always adorned in his family's yellow garb\u2014remained indifferent to the moral dilemmas plaguing his subjects. He envisioned a singular path towards unity and was willing to pay the high price it demanded; he worked relentlessly to achieve this goal throughout the 66 years of his reign.",
										"Reinholdt embarked on his reign by centralizing laws, consolidating military power, and dealing sternly with any who sought to undermine his authority. This increasing concentration of power was leveraged for personal gain, akin to feudal practices, and many were concerned by his decisions. He perceived these as necessary sacrifices for the attainment of his grand future.",
										"As the government grew more centralized, it executed a radical plan\u2014banning all religions within the state\u2014 earning Reinholdt the moniker of Godless King. Thus began a period of ruthless prosecution of those who held on to their 'worthless gods'. Simultaneously, a vast indoctrination program was set into motion, imposing upon citizens the learning of songs and propaganda glorifying the government. These were mandated across all educational institutions and public spaces. This shift from a religiously diverse society to a godless one was expedited due to the dwindling display of divine power. The ancient tales of gods and their miracles paled in comparison to the modern advancements brought forth by mortals. All of Luyarnha was to bend the knee to the Silverblood rule, lest it be met with a red wave of blood.",
										"Convinced by his own propaganda, the Godless King began to perceive himself as a god\u2014he who was driven by grand visions and possessed the voice of creation. It seemed only righteous, then, for him to make decisions that would sculpt the nation's future. He declared himself the only God worthy of worship, outlawing all other religions. In his pursuit of unity, he imprisoned and executed thousands, targeting believers and political adversaries alike. The diverse cultural landscape was crushed beneath the weight of the state, and Luyarnha was brought under the singular banner of the Godless King, invoking both fear and reverence. Days were dedicated to his worship, songs composed in his honor, and history books were revised to glorify his reign. However, he harbored an appreciation for religious architecture, and spared most religious structures, as they were a source of pride for the city.",
										"The Godless King nurtured ambitions of global dominance for his lineage. He diverted substantial resources towards military development and weaponry, whilst systematically eradicating beliefs in anything other than the state. During his reign, Luyarnha's military prowess saw a significant boost, particularly as the Elven Enclave in the west grappled with its internal conflicts. Seeing an opportunity, he instituted a compulsory draft to amplify Luyarnha's military, establishing extensive military infrastructure and compelling the populace to serve, with the threat of incarceration looming over dissenters. This coercive measure soon became routine, leading to a mostly voluntary military force.",
										"Concurrently, the human empire was obliterated, seemingly overnight, leaving only ashes in its wake and no survivors to explain the sudden vanishing of an entire nation. Fearful of the fate that befell the humans\u2014and perhaps aware of the cause of their fate\u2014the Godless King rerouted most of the country's finances towards plans of war. As the Elven Enclave weakened and internal conflicts rose, the Godless King, apprehensive that the force that annihilated the humans might turn towards him, hastened his invasion plans. This fear, however, was to prove his undoing."

										"In a grave miscalculation, the Godless King's public proclamation of his intent to conquer the Elven Enclave, ill-mixed with the grievous mishandling of the public's perception, kindled the spark of dissent that marked the onset of his downfall.",
										"The people of Luyarnha bore the suffering under the regime, lured by the allure of a brighter future. Yet, the moment they realized this future was founded on the impending subjugation of the elven realm, a realm many still held in high regard due to shared ancestry, resentment began to seep in. Elves, after all, are the keepers of deep-rooted memories, and the state's recent\u2014by elven reckoning\u2014propagandistic endeavors could not extinguish these ties. The fact that Luyarnha was a city more accustomed to the clatter of trade than the clang of swords further intensified the resistance against sending their offspring to a war that wasn't theirs to fight. This sentiment resonated most profoundly amongst the orcish populace who had watched too many of their kin fall in the clan wars of old, before finding refuge within Luyarnha's walls.",
										"This led to civil unrest, which was furthered by the Radiant Church; what was once a niche sect was given room to proliferate when all other religions had to bend the knee. Indeed, followers of the Radiant One stood strong in their belief and would keep showing faith even on the gallows. Such conviction moved many to join their cause. Thus, many military leaders\u2014those who were charged with maintaining the peace\u2014began to turn their back on the aristocracy, driven not only by newfound faith, but also by the tantalizing allure of the Church's promises of riches and prosperity.",
										"This tension ignited a bloody and brutal civil war.",
										"The civil war tore through the city for months on end, cleaving through the once resplendent Spired District. The arcane arts, a rare and coveted gift that coursed through the veins of the king and those of his blood, were ruthlessly wielded. During this violent strife, the citizens were introduced to the dark arts of osteomancy\u2014a malevolent and hitherto unseen magic. Yet, adversity is the mother of invention, and the now powerful Radiant Church found ways to counter these arcane horrors. As the conflict wore on, it became evident that the revolutionary forces would emerge triumphant, the populace rallying to their cause and the once-dreaded royal magic proving unsuccessful against the Church and its adherents.",
										"In the final throes of the civil war, the Church laid siege to the Silverbloods, holed up in their castle and bracing for a last stand they knew they couldn't win. However, unbeknownst to them, betrayal was brewing within their own ranks; the king's brother, in a desperate pact with the Church, agreed to assassinate the king in return for the survival and salvaged prestige of the Silverblood lineage. He carried out his dark promise, plunging a dagger into his brother's heart before the aghast eyes of the revolutionary crowd. The Radiant Church upheld their end of the pact, sparing the remainder of the Silverblood family.",
										"Those who were present during the Godless King's murder heard him talk in an impossible language, laying a curse upon Luyarnha with his last breath. None is sure of what this posthumous act of spite entailed, though some speculate that his objective was to bring ruin upon the city he once ruled, a punishment to the people who betrayed him, in the form of the Scourge.",
										"In the aftermath, chaos swept over Luyarnha. With no clear political path forward, the nation found itself in disarray. The Church assumed an interim governance role, overtaking the Grand Cathedral District, while the surviving Silverbloods, under the watchful eyes of their new overseers, were reluctantly enlisted to aid in restoring order."

										"News of Luyarnha's vulnerability reached the monstrous nations of the south, who deemed this the opportune moment to strike. Thus, under the sky of a crimson moon, the First War dawned on the city-state.",
										"When the bells of war began to toll, emissaries were sent to the neighboring countries requesting help, in vain. The once majestic human empire was nothing but ash; meanwhile, the Elven Enclave was consumed by its own internal struggles, unable to spare a thought or soldier for the unfolding tragedy to their east.",
										"Yet, amidst these dire odds, the southern wall of the city, built years prior to protect against the seasonal bestial incursions, was now the core of its defense and survival, holding strong against the southern marauders. Though a handful of the vile beasts breached this bulwark, the vast majority of the war's horrors unfolded outside the city's margins.",
										"It was a ballet of death and despair, yet Luyarnha, due to its entrenched position and fortified defenses, seemed to dance with a grace that surprised even the citizens. The city was holding its own, emerging victorious in the initial skirmishes of the war. Further bolstering this surprising resistance were the unexpected allies\u2014the cursed-bloods and the dwarves\u2014who stepped forth as the drums of war began to beat. The cursed-bloods, outcasts yet invaluable, showcased masonry skills that bordered on the divine. Without their tireless efforts in preserving and reinforcing the city walls, Luyarnha would have crumbled under the onslaught within months, a story most tend to forget.",
										"Thus, in the face of mounting odds, Luyarnha was able to weather the early stages of the First War, owing to the fortitude of its inhabitants and the unsung heroes who lent their hands to the city's survival."

										"The wheel of war churned mercilessly, and the scene in Luyarnha darkened. The enemy changed its tactics; it tasked guerilla forces shrouded in veils of illusion to utilize the chaos sowed by their savage beasts as a smokescreen and infiltrate the city. They melded into the population, masquerading as everyday citizens. The bestial southerners, wolves in sheep's clothing, bared their fangs only once within the heart of the city, spreading terror and bloodshed in equal measure. And so, Luyarnha found itself ensnared in a conflict of two fronts\u2014one beyond its sturdy walls, the other festering within its very heart.",
										"The city-state, overwhelmed by this maelstrom of violence and betrayal, strained under the burden. Holding off the monstrous hordes from the south was a colossal task unto itself. Combating an insidious foe within, a task far more daunting. Such was the cunning of the southern forces.",
										"Before this daunting reality, the Radiant Church unshackled the Obitus Scholare\u2014a specialized task force born amidst the flames of the civil war\u2014from all moral and legal obligations. Once formed to counter the arcane might of the fallen royalty, they were now consigned the task of forging human weapons that could quell the storm of the First War. As soon as hostilities erupted, the Obitus were handed all research artifacts and arcane knowledge previously hoarded by the fallen Silverblood royalty. Alongside them, another group of learned individuals emerged from the city's desperate cries for salvation\u2014the Scions. Both factions, standing to gain from the war's grim bounty, crafted tools of destruction that would enable Luyarnha to retaliate.",
										"The war continued its dreadful dance, a merciless juggernaut that trampled and erased the villages encircling Luyarnha, leaving trails of ruin in its wake. One such settlement was cruelly drowned in a flood of corrosive acid\u2014a despicable act of cruelty by the southern invaders. The battlefield was awash with death and despair, and Luyarnha and its wall were on the brink of succumbing. Just as hope appeared to wane, the Obitus Scholare heralded a breakthrough.",

										"Their magnum opus, the first jaeger, an augmented warrior equipped with superhuman capabilities and tracking prowess, was unveiled. This warrior could not only root out the infiltrators within the city, but also slay the beasts that accompanied them, quickly neutralizing the inside threat. The original jaeger was none other than Steinhardt, the second offspring of the Godless King. Steinhardt, an enigmatic figure hitherto unseen by the populace, stepped forth from the shadows to become a beacon of hope. Following Steinhardt's emergence, a new breed of jaegers trained by the Obitus and the Church began to turn the tide against the invaders. To this day, jaegers born of the First War are called the First Jaegers, and to this day, no one but the Obitus knows the secret behind the jaeger's creation; many were once boys, turned into men by the blood, the old blood shed in the war.",
										"Parallel to this, the Scions had their moment under the limelight, presenting a wonder of artificial life\u2014the Manikins. These sentient robotic entities offered Luyarnha much-needed reinforcements, another layer of defense against the encroaching southern tide.",
										"These technological leaps turned the tables on the southerners. Their guerrilla tactics were rendered moot, and the city's walls, which they had once come so close to breaching, now stood as an unyielding barrier. With Luyarnha's infrastructure revamped by the Godless King, the city-state was entirely self-sufficient, untroubled by severed trade routes. On the contrary, it was the southerners who faced the grim specter of dwindling rations and ammunition. Their encampment close to the city's walls merely served as an inviting target for Luyarnha's cannons. After enduring years of conflict, the southerners sounded their retreat, surrendering Luyarnha its victory.",
										"Yet in the wake of this conflict, there was no glory to bask in, no joy to revel in. What remained was a graveyard of brave hearts and broken dreams, and a fragile peace that hung in the balance. Or so everyone dared to hope."

										"The citizens, having found solace in the Church's dedication and faith, resolved to entrust them with the reins of power, at least for the time being, amidst the political void left by the Silverblood royalty's downfall.",
										"Despite their diminished status, the Silverblood, fortified by Steinhardt's sweeping popularity, clung to their place within the power structure. A new queen ascended, her influence severely diminished, yet the Church acknowledged the strategic boon of her family's wisdom during the war. Therefore, a degree of political power was granted, albeit grudgingly.",
										"The once grand Spired District, now a ruin, was resurrected from its ashes and rechristened as the New Bridge District. The Scions, tasked with orchestrating the mammoth repair efforts, deemed it an ideal location for their operations. Pouring vast resources into the restoration, they harnessed the abilities of their Manikin creations to expedite the process.",
										"The Obitus Scholare relocated to the confines of the Grand Cathedral District, sharing its hallowed grounds with the Church's executive functions. Here, they were entrusted with significant funds to further research initiatives intended to uplift the populace\u2014a vision the Radiant Church eagerly fostered.",
										"With its newfound political ascendancy, the Church found the ground fertile for spreading their doctrines, both within and beyond their city's boundaries. A major portion of Luyarnha's populace began gravitating towards their faith, and trade routes were flung open to neighboring and distant nations, even those far beyond the purview of the human and elven empires. This era heralded the introduction of novel technologies like railways, forging connections where none existed before.",
										"Commerce burgeoned anew, welcoming fresh faces into the Radiant city and birthing vast fortunes. Yet, memories of past invasions lingered like persistent shadows. The city's protective wall was reinforced with layers of unyielding stone and steel, an indomitable testament to Luyarnha's resolve, and a silent warning to any daring to threaten its peace.",
										"Conversely, this period of growth marked the dwindling of the arcane. While magic was always an elusive commodity, the rapid technological strides\u2014tools within everyone's grasp\u2014pushed arcane research to the periphery. Particularly as technology doesn't possess the harrowing aftermath of the arcane, especially evident with osteomancy. In the event known as the Great Unchaining, this accursed magic unleashed its malevolent wrath on its very practitioners. Many scholarly lives were extinguished in its unforgiving grasp, necessitating the Church to mobilize its martial might to exterminate the monstrous horrors spawned by this cataclysm."

However, these creatures seemed to be phantoms of the night, leaving no evidence of their existence come morning light.",
										"At first, the Church and its delegates staunchly dismissed such monstrous sightings, successfully easing the citizens' simmering panic. But as time passed, tales of nocturnal horrors multiplied. With each new day, the ghastly evidence mounted\u2014a lifeless body discovered at dawn, trails of crimson on cobblestones, and even citizens vanishing without a trace.",
										"As the public outcry grew, the Church's initial denial took on a stricter tenor. No longer were citizens allowed to venture out at nightfall as the threat began to reveal its terrifying reality. Instead, the Church dispatched its trained hunters into the night to combat these unseen beasts, while ordinary citizens were forced to seek refuge behind locked doors.",
										"This wave of horrors appeared to originate from the Ruby District, the focal point of the Church's interventions. Yet, despite their warriors' valiant efforts, fresh monstrosities seemed to emerge each night. Recognizing the gravity of the situation, the Church officially acknowledged the growing menace, now dubbed the Scourge. Citizens willing to fight were recruited to protect their loved ones and their city. The sealing of the Ruby District happened after a Blood Moon, particularly after the 33rd Hunt\u2014the Church calls these crimson moons Hunts, shifting the emphasis to the hunters prepared rather than the beasts to come\u2014where the beasts were animated with vicious frenzy and countless hunters were lost; the Ruby District that was teetering on the edge was completely lost that night.",

The looming external threats from neighboring nations forced the Church's hand into placing the entire city under lockdown. Outside countries warned that if the Scourge wasn't quelled, they would unite to erase Luyarnha from existence. All politicians, burdened by the memory of fighting on multiple fronts in the First War, knew full well that fighting on multiple fronts would mean the end of the city-state, and conceded to their demands."

The scholars among them discerned the correlation between the city's fate and the whims of the moon, its cryptic shifts spelling doom for those caught in its pallid light. Once, these celestial oscillations were a secret known only to the intellectuals, a knowledge invaluable for predicting the ominous rise of the Blood Moons. Yet in recent times, the entire city has become privy to this terrifying spectacle, the silent dread of the cosmos etched on every face that dares look up at the inky sky.",

Citizens voluntarily remain confined to their abodes, ceding the night to the hunters, their only protectors against the vile creatures birthed from the Scourge. Fear has become a constant companion in the shadowed corners and narrow alleyways of Luyarnha.",

Despite the overwhelming odds, the courageous hunters continue their relentless crusade, their weapons glinting under the cold moonlight.",

										"Fear courses through the halls of knowledge, as scholars are consumed by the terror that they may have trespassed beyond the boundaries of mortal comprehension. Whispers of dread and foreboding seep through the city, tales of the coming of an eternal night, when all light will be swallowed, and no spark of radiance will remain to guide them.",
										"Despite the encroaching darkness, Luyarnha continues its grim struggle for survival. The Scourge's malign influence is most potent in the Ruby District, but even beyond its boundaries, the city's defenses are starting to crumble under the relentless assault. On the edge of oblivion, Luyarnha perseveres, clenching its teeth against the onslaught, a city besieged, yearning for a day of respite and peace."

						"The birth of the Radiant Faith was sparked by divine revelations from the Prophet Luminara, foretelling the forthcoming Radiant Ascendancy\u2014a time when the Radiant One's glow would illuminate the world. From its humble beginnings as a seed of faith in the hearts of a select few, it flourished into a spiritual canopy that now stretches over the entirety of Luyarnha.",

								"The Radiant Church's faith holds two fundamental tenets that are integral to their belief. The first is a conviction that true goodness is inextricably linked to strength. Weakness is seen as a vice, a craven display of cowardice rather than a virtue to be upheld. The Radiant clergy expect their followers to be brave, to stand tall in the face of adversity, and to be a beacon of strength for those around them.",
								"This belief in strength is grounded in the understanding that those who are weak act out of fear, rather than a genuine desire to do good. This is not to say that acts of kindness are without merit, but the Radiant Church asserts that the only true benevolence comes from a place of fortitude and resilience. It is a difficult yet powerful philosophy that has led the church to many victories in the past. Leading by example, many of the major figures within the church stand out as giants amongst their fellow citizens, capable of impressive physical displays of power.",
								"The second core belief of the Radiant Church is one of hope for the future. They hold firm to the idea that despite the trials and tribulations of the present, a bright and prosperous tomorrow is within reach. They recognize the immense progress that has been made over the centuries; their lives are far more advanced than their forebears could have ever dreamed. It is the church's duty to ensure continued prosperity, and devout followers are confident that they are the vanguard of a brighter future. Their faith and devotion ensure that progress continues in the years to come, and that none lose the light of hope throughout the world.",

										"Not all the ideas within the Radiant Church are original to them. One such powerful belief that permeates the church is the concept of heaven and hell. Many other religions share these ideas of a guardian at the gate, who upon death determines if ones life was worthy enough to ascend to the higher planes, or if one should descend to the foul planes for an eternity of torture.",
										"The Radiant Faith shares these beliefs, holding to the idea that we are all birthed with light and darkness in our soul, and depending on the deeds we perform, this light shines brighter or darker. The choices we make can either fuel the light or feed the darkness within us. But this principle extends beyond individuals; it's believed that the collective sins of many can push the world towards heaven or hell. With the Scourge currently ravaging the city, there's a growing fear that it's an omen of the city plunging towards hell's icy grasp.",
										"This duality seems embodied within the religion, as all the most righteous saints of the Radiant Church possess eyes of gold. Conversely, those who commit the foulest of sins do not possess darkened eyes, probably due to the fact that once one begins a road filled with sins, the Radiant Faith seems unimportant and is quickly abandoned. Though if one is to meet an individual of darkened iris and sclera, they know better than to approach too close, as sin darkens their heart. Cursed-bloods know of this hatred far too well\u2014they who possess obsidian eyes."

								"In ages past, decades after the city-state of Luyarnha was crowned with sovereignty, a decline in religious worship began to take root. The ruling class, in their hubris, declared the veneration of the divine to be illegal and mandated the substitution of the sacred with a series of ceremonies praising their leader and their flawless government. This edict was inculcated in each household and each school so that none would entertain dangerous ideas. Further compounding this abandonment of faith was the crowning of the Godless King, a man who perceived religion to be a mere distraction for the masses, incompatible with his vision of the future; the state was perfect and eternal, and no mere god would alter that.",
								"In the campaign to eradicate religious worship from the city, most gods\u2014beings who derived their power through veneration from mortals\u2014were abandoned and forgotten. Yet, amidst this destruction of faith, a budding light refused to die, the Radiant Faith, proudly held up by the hearts of many devout souls who couldn't abandon hope. Initially, many dismissed them as yet another group destined to be crushed under the weight of the state doctrine. How wrong they were.",

Brutally eviscerated, his innards splayed and nailed to the four corners, Luminara was left to die. However, during this savage spectacle, Luminara did not plead nor scream, but prayed to his god for forgiveness. When the King completed his grotesque performance, Luminara wept not for himself, but for the corrupted heart of the King, pitying him even in the face of death\u2014an act that sent the ruler into a bestial frenzy. This public act of defiance bolstered the faith, elevating Luminara to martyrdom and sainthood, and he henceforth became known as the Luminary Prophet. The symbol of his sacrifice, the Innarda, became the emblem for the Radiant Faith.",
								"Three days following his cruel demise, disciples of the Luminary Prophet bore witness to visions of him, radiant with heavenly luminescence, proclaiming his transcendence to a higher existence. These spectral visitations stoked the faith with renewed purpose and zeal, marking the commencement of the Radiant Ascendancy. In this ascendance, believers saw the Luminary Prophet transformed into a divine conduit for their eternal lord, the Radiant One. This was the beacon of hope they had prayed for, here to cast away the age of darkness.",

										"News of their good deeds rapidly spread, and soon most of the city's lower districts were erecting churches and cathedrals to worship the Radiant One in obstinate defiance of the ruling class, for as the power of the Church grew, faith in the state and its benevolence began to erode. The tension between the two camps mounted, fueled by the ruling class's treatment of the citizenry, their rapaciousness, and their pretentious ceremonies. The conflict culminated in a civil war that the nobility lost, forcing them to kneel as the military forces, abject moralists, and resentful subjects that supported them were slowly supplanted by a more hopeful kin that rejected their tyranny. They were thus compelled to surrender before any further bloodshed could ensue. On that day\u2014 called the Day of Deliverance\u2014the Godless King's heart was stabbed from behind, his body then unceremoniously cast to the populace to do as they wished with the tyrant's remains.

Despite the growing evidence of this corruption, the church leadership turned a blind eye, choosing to prioritize its reputation and influence over the purity of its message, attempting to maintain the hegemony of the city. Perhaps it was pride, or simply a refusal to admit the truth, but their noble ideals were soon tarnished, leading to internal conflicts and divisions within the church."

But since their fall from grace and the Godless King, they have lost the ability to make such judgements. Instead, nobles have opted to use their funds to develop increasingly more powerful weapons, ones that would be too dangerous to be distributed widely among the populace, as a single person with the wrong mindset accessing them would signal doom for all. In response, the Church, well aware that many within the nobility have a corrupted mindset, developed jaegers and other human weapons.

										"The Obitus Scholare was an enigma, an assembly cloaked in the pursuit of esoteric lore and ancient wisdom, delving deep into the remnants of dead civilizations in a quest to unearth long-forgotten marvels, hoping to utilize the lost knowledge for the world's benefit. Its pursuit gained extraordinary momentum when the Silverblood royalty fell under the Radiant Church's sway. As a grand gift, the church entrusted the Obitus Scholare with the Silverbloods' trove of arcane texts and relics. This archive, amassed meticulously by the family\u2014and notably the Godless King before his demise\u2014was an intricate labyrinth of cursed artifacts and dusty tomes, each potentially hiding a myriad of unique secrets.",

										"Among these cryptic documents, a few members discovered mentions of an ancient ritual site hidden beneath the very roots of Luyarnha. Employing their base, the Asylum, as the entrance to this subterranean secret, they ventured into the bowels of the earth, guided by the arcane inscriptions and the haunting visions that seized their minds. Here, in this clandestine world, they erected a now-forgotten temple, a hallowed ground where they claimed communion with what they believed to be the true Radiant One, a cosmic being that bestowed enlightenment upon them. There, a new, heretical version of the Radiant Faith sprouted in the heart of the Obitus Scholare.",
										"This encounter heralded an era of grand flourishing, as the enlightened Obitus birthed a plethora of creations to alleviate Luyarnha's suffering. Its repertoire of inventions ranged from the reviled hounds assisting hunters, to formidable weapons for combating the armies of the South, to the virtuosic blood archers and the failed living nightmares, to their most astounding achievement, the jaegers\u2014enhanced warriors that tower as demi-gods over ordinary mortals. The Obitus also claimed the discovery of the Holy Tonic, a miraculous brew whose recipe remains a jealously guarded secret.",
										"Their thirst for knowledge led the members of the Obitus down a morally abhorrent path, the chilling hallways of their laboratories bearing witness to a litany of macabre experiments. They explored the frontiers of infection and cure, conducted transplants between disparate creatures, and harvested the cerebro-spinal fluid of Great Ones to infuse into various apparatuses. More profoundly, to commune with the cosmos, they began to employ a neutered form of osteomancy, etching runes into their skulls. The most advanced among them wore golden masks to conceal their fleshless craniums, adorned with an intricate network of runes and eyes, allowing them to gaze into the depths of the cosmos and beckon the moon.",
										"A theory, only held by those privy of the faction's dark actions, suggests that the Scourge was unintentionally\u2014or perhaps intentionally\u2014brought upon the city by the Obitus Scholare. For them, who possess an unending thirst for power, the possibility that they birthed the Scourge during a disastrously misguided experiment is not too far-fetched. Perhaps, in their pursuit of ascension, they inadvertently sparked this plague, their eyes too focused on what lies beyond."

This act of democratizing power was designed to keep the nobility in check, preventing their dominance were they to thirst for power anew, and to aid in the fierce conflict against the southern invaders. Indeed, it was successful; the war tilted in their favor, owing in no small part to the force of osteomancy. Yet, a few years hence, a grotesque event referred to as the Great Unchaining unfolded on the triduum of the fourth Hunt. The majority of osteomancy practitioners either suffered a horrific demise or were transfigured into grotesque abominations. In the aftermath, the practice of the magic was promptly banned, its teachings concealed in the deepest vaults, hidden from inquisitive eyes.",
												"This tragic occurrence scarred the reputation of the Obitus Scholare and dealt a damaging blow to its prestige, yet its resolve remained unbroken. By this point, the sect's leadership was fully enmeshed in the faith they had discovered in the god unearthed from the cryptic subterranean chambers, and so they decided to delve deeper. Even in the face of the staggering deaths they had caused, they held steadfast to their thirst for power, well aware that the point of no return was far behind them. Any semblance of remorse was ruthlessly purged from their ranks\u2014many that exhibited such weakness killed themselves, their corpses frequently bearing a bullet hole at the back of the neck\u2014ensuring that the faction's ultimate objectives remained shrouded. To the Church, they wore a facade of unwavering loyalty, whilst in secrecy, they continued their insidious quest.",

														"Within the walls of the Asylum, adjacent to their holy temple, the scholars enacted their harrowing experiments. The formidable powers they invoked exacted a toll, a vast levy in mortal lives. Initially, their ghastly trials targeted captured giants from the war, for few in Luyarnha harbored qualms about tormenting those who had struck them first. However, the supply of sacrificial lives gradually diminished, and yet, intoxicated by rapid advancements, the Obitus balked at cessation. Its leadership had glimpsed their potential ascendance and would not rest until humanity had elevated to higher spheres of existence; they required more lives for their macabre experimentation."

The exact details of what the church unearthed and how the Obitus was prosecuted remain shrouded in mystery. The sparse record of the event suggests that only a single, deranged branch of the Obitus had veered into darkness, while the majority of its scholars, in opposition, had created the jaegers through less abhorrent means. Even under the severe trials of the House of Blood, which coerced the truth to surface, none of the jaegers recalled the Asylum or its dreadful experiments. Overwhelming evidence absolved the Obitus, condemning only the branch manager of the Asylum and his subordinates, who were incarcerated within the Abyssal Keep, most meeting their ends therein.",

Yet many of its scholars yearned for the powers of the Great Ones that their visions had unveiled, a hunger they could not ignore, and in a masterstroke of deception, the Obitus Scholare separated its endeavors.",
														"The Obitus maintained its \"sanitized\" studies within the Observatory, which crowned the Grand Cathedral District and was meant as an open testament to its diligence and righteousness. Meanwhile, the shadowy underbelly of its work was relegated to the Cosmic Seminary, nestled by the tranquil lake that feeds Luyarnha's river and hidden away from prying Church eyes. The Radiant Church, upon rigorous inspections of the Observatory, found their trust in the Obitus renewed, oblivious to the macabre reality\u2014or perhaps willfully blind. Thus, the Obitus Scholare regained the church's favor, even as it persisted in its unspeakable acts behind cloistered walls.",

The Scribes hold themselves to a high standard; failure to meet such a requirement means erasure of the text and the destruction of hours of combined labor.",

Accusations of personal gain, of altering the rule of law to favor individual pockets over Luyarnha's common good, swirled in like wildfire. The subsequent investigation led to the incarceration of several implicated members, some with connections to the reviled fire dancers, leaving the Church to pray fervently that this blight of corruption had not tainted their ranks any further."

In the vacuum created by withheld information, wild conjectures and dark conspiracies flourish. A common belief is that the Scribes harbor information about the origin of the Scourge, a secret they refuse to unveil, fearing a societal backlash.",

Their sweat and labor breathed life into the very stones, forging a bastion of protection against the encroaching darkness and bonds of brotherhood between the workers. The infirmaries, overwhelmed with the sick and the wounded after hunts, found solace in the hands of those sentenced to tend to the afflicted.",

Transportation, too, became a crucial lifeline in a city fractured by chaos and danger. Those who had erred were conscripted to ensure that essential goods and supplies reached their destinations, a vital artery sustaining the city-state's fragile existence.",
														"In this dark epoch, Luyarnha demanded sacrifice and labor from all its denizens, but most especially from those who had defied its laws. In the crucible of calamity, even the transgressors were called upon to serve, their redemption forged in the fires of adversity, and rare were the sins that were too grave to forgive."

Built on multiple floors\u2014as above, so below\u2014the Grand Cathedral is said to be able to house the entirety of Luyarnha's population in times of crisis, though access to it is not so easily granted.",

In his era, the building underwent an identity transformation, becoming a hub for state functions and military operations. Following the king's downfall, the Radiant Church assumed command, spearheading the completion of construction. Consequently, the structure metamorphosed into the intended sacred cathedral, though now its halls echo with worship solely of the Radiant One.",

These gardens are more than mere ornamentation; they serve a dual purpose, acting as decoy obscuring the formidable ramparts of the cathedral.",

Incense and faerie lights are utilized, alongside watchful guards perched on towers with cannons and firearms primed for action. However, as night descends, the cathedral's doors close, imposing a stringent lockdown.",

Simultaneously, those unable to return to their homes outside must resign to spending the night within the cathedral's confines. If left without lodging, they face the discomfort of navigating the cathedral's corridors, filled with overpowering religious incense designed to repel and expose any hidden beasts. The few unfortunate creatures that manage to sneak within the walls despite this aromatic deterrent face the swift retribution of the Radiant Order. Such is the cathedral's impregnable defense that the fall of this bastion would spell the doom of Luyarnha itself, for within its sacred walls dwell the city's elite warriors and high clergy, making it as much a military bastion as a grand cathedral.",

The Beast Incense, or Beast Repellant as it is commonly known, is a relatively inexpensive byproduct of these rituals. When sanctified by the Ministry of Light, it emanates a sickly sweet aroma. While this scent is easily overlooked by humans, it is profoundly repugnant to most beasts, including the scourgeborne. Consequently, the cathedral's walls are conspicuously devoid of these creatures compared to other city districts.",
										"The Beast Incense has found its way into many homes across Luyarnha, serving as a deterrent for nightly prowling beasts. However, its use has caused unrest in the Ruby District, where altered versions of the incense sold in black markets failed to fend off beasts, leading to a disastrous incident before the hunters could intervene. In truth, the incense's purpose is not to immobilize the beasts, merely to deter them with its offensive aroma. This means that those not employing the incense become prime targets if their neighbors do, an exploitable loophole for malevolent individuals. By simply snuffing out a neighbor's incense in the dead of night, they can expose them to beastly assaults\u2014a nearly perfect crime that is difficult to prove."

No one escapes this commitment; even those with physical disabilities receive mechanical aids to ensure their participation.

However, since the surge of the Scourge, many extend their service beyond the mandated three years, taking up full-time roles as the city's protectors. This decision often disappoints their families who yearn for their safe return home. The age of conscription varies across races due to disparate maturation rates\u2014 humans and elves begin at 18, while orcs who age faster start at 12.

An urban labyrinth of shifting stairs and precarious bookshelves simulates a volatile battlefield against beasts that attack from all angles. This unconventional training environment is crucial, teaching hunters to secure their footing amid chaos. Despite many fractured bones and bruised egos, the price of such training is deemed worthwhile for the honor of becoming a hunter.",
								"The second tower, the Pillar of Blood, symbolizes Virtue. Nestled at its base is the House of Blood, where justice takes its course. Encased within Saint Victoria Church, the House of Blood is open for prayer when not in use for trials. However, the lingering scent of blood often deters the faithful. Rising above the House of Blood are statues of the Church's revered martyrs, representations of the virtues they aspire to embody. The pinnacle of the tower is a sanctified observation chamber, bathed in a kaleidoscopic glow from countless stained glass windows. In this radiant sanctum, the Church's high-apostles convene to guide the city's future. Among them is the successor to High-Apostle Tulio, a strong advocate for devolving power to the people, fearing unchecked power may corrupt the Church. Her plea, however, largely falls on deaf ears.",

This trifold toll echoes on the first two days the Blood Moon of Rebirth is sighted, and once more an hour before its zenith. This sonorous prelude not only girds the city for impending survival struggles but also washes fear from the hearts of the prepared hunters. It isn't a knell for the imminent fall of hunters but rather a permission, a signal to embrace their inner bloodlust and unleash wrath upon the Scourge's creatures.

They viewed these afflictions as political tools employed by the powerful to enforce their ideologies. Thus, following the King's fall, the Asylum was abandoned, but its silence was short-lived. With the Obitus' acquisition of the Silverblood family archives, they sought a covert location for their clandestine experiments, safe from southern adversaries. Consequently, the Asylum was resurrected, flinging open its doors to a new era under the rule of the Obitus Scholare.",

The proximity of the asylum to the city sewers caused the wails of tormented patients to echo and surface within the cathedral, unsettling the residents. During the initial war, this peculiarity was overlooked, as everyone was on high alert. However, following the war's end, the experimentation on prisoners became more apparent, the mysterious wails provoking suspicion and alarm. After an especially brutal round of experiments which echoed throughout the Grand Cathedral, the Church dispatched inquisitors to trace these spine-chilling sounds. The Asylum, by then converted to an experimental chamber, was subsequently sealed off. The horrifying sounds were attributed to a wayward pack of Roaring Manes, and the Obitus relocated their experimental facilities to a Grand Cathedral spire. Today, the Asylum stands eerily vacant, yet whispers persist among the cathedral's inhabitants of the chilling echoes that continue to seep from its depths.",

Fate, however, had other designs, as the manikins were conscripted for war, their potential as laborers left unrealized. The city's sealing has exacerbated this scarcity, stifling the influx of materials necessary for new constructs needed to replace those destroyed in the war.

In those dark days, when the Church was weaving an intricate tapestry of lies to keep the populace in blissful ignorance of the growing threat, it was the Scions' creations that wiped clean the streets of the gruesome vestiges of the nightly hunts.",

										"In the warped realm of morality that exists among the Scions, survival of the many is a priority, even at the cost of the few. The genesis of this faction was the manifestation of an orc's fear for the impending oblivion of his kin under the Godless King's brutal reign. He poured his essence, every ounce of his survival instinct, into breathing life into the Scions, nurturing the organization into a financial powerhouse amid the desolation of Luyarnha.",
										"Bound by their founder's vision, the Scions birthed the Lightning Vessels, warriors of shocking prowess, in their relentless pursuit of survival. They looked upon the Church's jaegers, warriors of unprecedented might, and their vision narrowed. The game of power had shifted; the Radiant Faith was gaining the upper hand, and the Scions had to adapt or perish. Their answer came in the form of the orphans, plentiful in the aftermath of the First War's carnage. These children, void of any future, were repurposed into vessels of deadly electricity, a process involving the ghastly integration of galvanized rods into their young spines followed by brutal electroshock treatments.",
										"This twisted experimentation yielded two outcomes\u2014a handful of individuals capable of harnessing the raw power of lightning, and a multitude left broken and maimed. This was a brutal tally that was deemed a necessary sacrifice in the Scions' twisted scheme of salvation. Over time, their methodology became more precise, reducing the number of casualties while honing their human weapons more effectively. This clandestine practice, its gruesome details kept under wraps by those involved, is hushed, the Scions aware that any leak would brand them heretics in the eyes of the Church, a righteous fury they would rather not bring upon themselves. Even the surviving subjects remain silent, their recollections too vague to piece together the horror of their past\u2014they were but infants\u2014 though they are haunted by elusive nightmares.",
										"These child-sacrifices, coldly calculated, were essential for the survival of the Scions, the successful few acting as the Scions' loyal defenders, another layer of protection against the Church and its jaegers.",
										"This disconcerting pattern continues today, with the Scions granting the nobility near exclusive access to their manikins. Their reasons being scarcity of resources, the city lockdown cutting off all trade routes that would grant them the elements necessary to their continued creation. They wager on the nobles' ability to keep these golden beings safer than they would be amidst the hunts, and bank on promised donations to further their research. This decision is further educated by the unfortunate hunting of manikins for their golden parts by remorseless individuals, solved simply by offering these prized constructs to the aristocracy, who are less likely to ambush them for gold they already possess in abundance.",
										"The Scions' refusal to send manikins into the fray disregards the lives lost to the relentless beasts, a sacrifice they deem necessary for their long-term survival strategy.

Their crowning achievement, the manikins, entities sculpted from ivory and gold, gifted life through the conduit of electricity, were birthed during the tumultuous times of the First War. These mechanical soldiers, devoid of human life, served as expendable front-line assets, diminishing the toll of human casualties in battle. No tears were shed for the fallen machines. In their creation, a calculated safeguard was introduced into the manikins' cognition, a defect that rendered them incapable of animosity towards their creators. This, in turn, capped their intellectual growth, an acceptable compromise for the Scions, who required obedient warriors, not scholars.",

They failed to appreciate their existing contributions: the life-sustaining electricity they generated, the flawless manikin servants they gifted the nobility, and their formidable arsenal of weapons. Succumbing to their fears, they gambled on a dangerous experiment they had vowed never to undertake\u2014bestowing full sentience upon a manikin, a move they hoped would edge them ahead of all competition.",
										"Their gamble proved disastrous. Upon awakening, the newly sentient construct, Malach, revolted against the servile existence his brethren endured, unleashing a slaughter that claimed dozens of Scions before he could be restrained. His escape from confinement, facilitated by his control over a dormant Galvanized Prowler, laid waste to the New Bridge District and saw him disappear into the Shrouded District. The Church, who encountered the rampaging prowler, mistook it for a new variant of monster birthed of the Scourge, a confusion that turned into fury when they discovered the Scion-made galvanized rods within its remains. They were then quick to accuse the Scions of creating the Scourge.",
										"What followed was one of the bloodiest trials in Luyarnha's history, which saw the Scions' leaders acquitted after the Church realized their initial accusation was unfounded. The Scourge had no connection to the felled prowler. Despite their contempt for the Scions, the Church knew the city relied heavily on their inventions. Ruining their reputation would hurt the city more than it would help. To salvage the Scions' reputation, the Church spun a tale of a newly discovered Scourge beast, quickly subdued by their valiant hunters. They couched the deceit within reassurances, reminding the public not to fear should such a creature appear again. Nevertheless, the Scions were burdened with the reparations for the havoc wreaked on the New Bridge District, their trial a reminder etched deep into the flesh and psyche of their leadership. Meanwhile, Malach lurks in the shadows, his wrath against his creators unfulfilled."

However, numerous scholars, who had ventured into the heart of the outbreak, protest this sudden halt, claiming to have been on the brink of a breakthrough. Moved by the many residents who willingly offered themselves up for any treatment, the scholars argue the cessation is unreasonably hasty and without adequate justification, especially with the potential identification of patient zero within reach.",

The aim is a harsh but calculated attempt to halt the Scourge's relentless spread and alleviate its crippling stranglehold on the city. The cellars of many buildings within the Ruby District have been stealthily stocked with combustible materials. The sinister strategy is to set the district ablaze under the pretense of the Scorching Moon, turning it into an inferno that incinerates the district, and with it, the Scourge."

This marginalization has resulted in dark thoughts taking root, leading some to surrender to despair, feeding themselves to the beasts in the absence of a reason to fight. The once-vibrant human community now lies fragmented, creating a palpable sense of isolation amidst the district. Despite efforts from Church missionaries to integrate them and provide the communal support they need, many humans rebuke the offer. They harbor resentment for the gods they believe abandoned them, blind to the proof of divine light in their midst. This phenomenon has been dubbed the 'human curse' by some orcs, as it seems to affect them disproportionately.",
								"Conversely, elves and orcs seem to flourish amidst hardship. The adversity only amplifies their tales of triumph. Having descended from generations who endured severe conditions outside city walls, they'd rather perish than see their district fall. This resolve is reflected in their work, irrespective of scale, because, in the glow of the Radiant One, even the minutiae matter.",

Oddly enough, this stranger was unknown to the local hunters, and his remains were conspicuously absent at daybreak. Since that fateful night, the beasts have asserted their dominance over the aqueduct, thwarting comprehensive repairs. With each eradication, more appear, slaughtering underprepared workers. As if possessed of an uncanny sentience, the beasts seem to obstruct this infrastructure that is vital to the city's survival. The prospect that someone might be consciously directing them, should they indeed possess such power, is dreadful.",

The prospect of drawing water directly from the potentially disease-ridden river that is the Moryanne is stirring fears, especially with the suspicion that the Scourge could be a waterborne infection. Presently, the Church seeks brave souls to delve deep into the aqueduct and shed light on the situation, hoping to find a solution before it's too late."

The district was once a thriving medley of sailors, traders, and cloak-and-dagger operatives, each striving to carve out an existence within tumultuous Luyarnha. Yet, in the wake of the city's blockade brought about by the Scourge, swathes of the district have succumbed to deterioration, at times projecting an eerie semblance of a ghost town. The once vibrant streets now lie desolate, a chilling silence replacing the hustle and bustle. The crisp river breeze, once a welcome respite on the sweltering plazas, now only instills shivers in the hearts of the few who dare to tread these deserted streets.",

Merchants from all corners of the world would be drawn to its shores, trading in exotic goods and cutting deals that could reshape destinies and empires.",
								"However, since the city's blockade, the harbor has fallen into near-abandon, devoid of incoming trade and commerce, the once resplendent bronze has now tarnished, tinging the streets with a gloomy palette. Many of its establishments were forced to shut their doors, and the few that remain\u2014mostly bars and pubs\u2014see their patronage steadily eroding. Indeed, the district's main inhabitants\u2014dwarves and cursed-bloods\u2014 aren't much for drinking; cultural norms deter the cursed-bloods, while dwarves entranced by the Deep One eschew such activities. The handful of humans and elves that reside in the district do visit these establishments sporadically, but for many shopkeepers, a harsh truth looms: if the Scourge doesn't end soon, their livelihoods will.",
								"In such dive bars, rumors can be heard, stipulating that the Scourge could be the outcome of an eldritch influence, an ancient, otherworldly power corrupting the life force of Luyarnha, turning its people into horrifying aberrations, like the weird dwarves many claim to have seen. Supporters of this theory often point towards the odd artifacts that the Moryanne River often spits out on its shores as a potential source of this corruption.",

However, a recent spike in unexplained ship sinkings, purportedly by sea creatures far larger than those typically found in the city, or malevolent third parties, has seeded hesitation among many. These days, most ships ply their trade in fishing, a desperate attempt to keep afloat and inject some life into the dwindling economy.",

As the Scourge of beasts originates from the land, the river presents a natural barricade that most of these creatures dare not cross, providing an unexpected refuge. However, the majority of these sought-after residences are already claimed by the cursed-bloods, and luyarnhians know that trespassing in their properties is met with severe punishment.",

They keep track of all rumors that circulate the city, as some are bound to be true, and crucial information can be sold for hefty profit, profit that is not always realized in the form of gold. To this day, they impact the city; indeed, when the Long Night descended and dwarves mysteriously disappeared, it was the Victorian Masonia that spurred the city's officials into action.

It was the primary checkpoint for incoming trade ships, a protocol established after the First War was declared, when a seemingly innocent ship loaded with gifts turned out to be a Trojan horse carrying soldiers ready for combat. Despite thwarting this surprise attack, city officials decided to take no chances, setting up a rigorous inspection process for all incoming vessels. Under the watchful eyes of cannons perched on the city walls, the ships would be escorted by military barges to the key. Once docked, the crew would disembark and be placed in a temporary holding area while soldiers inspected the ship from top to bottom. To maintain security, only two ships would be allowed to enter the city at a time, forcing the rest to wait outside the heavily fortified city walls. This enforced delay at times led to spoilage of goods as ships sometimes had to wait for days before getting clearance. Once a ship was thoroughly inspected and granted passage, it could venture further into the heart of the Waterfront District, ascend towards the Sanctified District, or traverse towards the bustling New Bridge District. Here, secure docks would accommodate the vessels for the duration of their stay, for a reasonable fee.",

Veering too close to the districts would elicit two warnings before the heavy artillery of Luyarnha would intervene to 'correct' their course.",

Additionally, commercial houses and a prison complex, known as the Abyssal Keep, were established on the island. The trade houses were places of negotiation where traders, mostly dwarves and orcs, would compete for the best deals with incoming merchants, as well as a place where said merchants could rest and be entertained until their arrival on the mainland of Luyarnha, or until their departure. The Abyssal Keep, on the other hand, was a prison that plunged into the abyss of Luyarnha's waters, reserved to those who break the law of the city."

Lush gardens, flourishing with an array of plants, cradle the district, crafting an Eden-like sanctuary that contrasts starkly with the teeming corruption sprawling within its walls. It is more than just a district; it is an exemplar of grandeur corroded by time, a fortified, sanctified garden of delights sullied by greed, a golden apple that houses more rot than a mound of corpses.",

Coupled with their devout faith and their efforts to further establish the Radiant Church's presence within the district, they have long earned the favor of the Church, who has rewarded them with some of the most prestigious estates in the city, seized from the hands of corrupt nobility. Among these is an ancient mansion adorned with a multitude of mirrors. Yet, the reflections they cast are not of the common reality, but of strange, otherworldly vistas. Another property the Moongold family was given hides a secret beneath its foundations: an ancient, sealed crypt. Despite the ominous appearance, the Moongolds are keen to proceed with that mansion's construction, welcoming the mystery within their domain, as exploring the unknown is what earned them their wealth and knowledge."

But despite their suspicions, the bank is their golden sanctuary too, housing their precious wealth amidst this creeping threat and instability. Moreover, the Radiant Church's attention is ensnared by problems of a more deadly and immediate nature, though they did move a vast amount of their wealth away from this vault and into their own coffers.

Finally, the optimistic among them, or perhaps deluded, view the Scourge as a sign of Luyarnha's impending ascension to higher planes of existence. They argue that, as the city experiences unprecedented growth and prosperity, this affliction is simply the next step in their evolution, albeit a painful and terrifying one.",

To abandon one's kin for the ephemeral pleasures of the flesh was deemed a pathetic fall from grace, a forfeiture of one's purpose and worth, particularly for those living in this lavish district, who could spare the wealth necessary to raise one's own.",

The orchestrator behind this fratricidal plot was the Radiant Church, who had already rallied the city under its divine banner. To save his lineage from impending annihilation, Brandt, compelled by desperation, aligned himself with the Church, a pact sealed in his brother's blood.

Those who reject the church's embrace might give birth in forsaken alleyways, casting their children away or consigning them to orphanages. A fortunate few, perhaps bolstered by exceptional financial fortitude or familial support, succeed in bearing their offspring and providing them with as normal a childhood as Luyarnha's grim circumstances allow.",

Various theories have been postulated in an attempt to fathom the origins of these peculiar offspring\u2014some conjecture that they serve as beacons, as the Great Ones disseminate their consciousness across the vast reaches of the cosmos, with fragments ultimately embedding themselves within the bodies of these unsuspecting mothers; consequently, the resulting progeny would function as a beacon to draw the Great Ones nearer to the world\u2014others suggest that, due to their intrinsic sterility, the Great Ones crave a surrogate through which to vicariously experience creation. However, the motives of these enigmatic entities are, by their very nature, inscrutable to the mortal mind, and any attempt to decipher their intentions is inherently constrained and flawed."

Their plundering persisted until they dared to trespass upon a dwelling that should have remained undisturbed, its walls etched with an archaic language, and its occupant patiently awaiting their intrusion. Unwittingly, they had captured the attention of an entity far more formidable than they could fathom.

Their capacity to rally disparate forces and marshal them under a single banner has been invaluable in countless conflicts, ultimately contributing to their elevated status within Luyarnha.",

Their ability to see multiple perspectives allows them to create plans that account for the needs and interests of various factions, fostering stability and prosperity within Luyarnha, though many of them aren't above making sure that these plans serve everyone, but mostly themselves, hiding this fact behind smiles and complex jargon, or simply hiding the better outcome that could be achieved, and only presenting the one benefiting them instead. Their human strength makes them resilient fighters, while their long lifespans from their elven lineage grant them the benefit of accumulated knowledge and experience."

										"Behind the stately facades of their mansions and the elegant veneer of their public personas, some Half-Elves can exhibit a sense of arrogance and haughtiness, particularly when they find themselves in the company of their own kind. Born of two worlds, they often perceive themselves as superior to both humans and elves, considering their mixed heritage as the pinnacle of racial refinement. This inflated self-image is reinforced by their numerous accomplishments and the great respect they command within Luyarnha. This pride can manifest in condescending behavior, smugness, and a propensity to dismiss the concerns of those they deem inferior. It is not uncommon for them to relish their position of power and wealth, flaunting their assets and influence to bolster their egos. This prideful demeanor, however, is not without consequence. Their arrogance can create rifts within their own ranks sowing seeds of discord, leading to the rise of rivalries, enmities, and vendettas, which are oft too common with the aristocracy and nobility, and threatens to unravel the delicate balance of power they have so skillfully maintained. Not all Half-Elves are consumed by arrogance, and many strive to rise above this flaw, recognizing the dangers it poses to themselves and the city they hold dear."

Despite the influence of the Radiant Church and its redemptive teachings, the human population remains largely resistant to the solace and guidance offered by the divine. In their relentless pursuit of individual achievement and self-reliance, they have become disconnected from the spiritual comfort and magic that could help them endure the grim reality of their existence, as they have for many others.",
										"This self-aggrandizing perspective has led many of them to believe that they can rival the higher powers, though they are oftentimes proven wrong. Indeed, in their attempts to defy the heavens, humans have frequently brought greater suffering upon themselves. Faced with the recent tragic circumstances that plague their city, many have adopted a nihilistic view, considering morality a mere feat of social engineering designed to make the pain that is life bearable. This dark mindset has led many down treacherous paths, and in their attempt to prove the meaninglessness of life, and most particularly their lives, they turn into vile creatures that ultimately make life worse for everyone around them; even if the monster they become on the inside doesn't always manifest in a terrifying outward appearance. Due to this hubris and propensity for self-destruction, humans are the ones who tend to succumb most often to the clutches of madness.",

Their achievements stand as a testament to the heights they can reach, while their flaws serve as the reminder of the depths to which they can fall. As they continue to navigate the treacherous city-state, humans have to grapple with their own nature, striking a balance between ambition and humility, in order to survive and perhaps thrive in a city teetering on the edge of madness."

Others contend that this unrelenting thirst for wealth is merely the result of a culture forged in hardship and adversity.

This allowed them to engage in acts of profound generosity, particularly as they entered the twilight of their years. Thus, a dual nature arose within them, marked by wealth-acquisition in their youth and magnanimity in their later years.",

The enigmatic figure at the head of this institution was himself an Orc, and many of the clergy who followed his teachings bore the same lineage.

Instead, they sought complete control over their labor, believing that it was better to acquire wealth in this way, striving to build their own empires within the city. Their imposing stature towered over most other humanoids, making them ideal candidates for more physically perilous roles.",
										"Younger Orcs, driven by the pursuit of wealth and greatness, often joined the ranks of the hunters. As protectors of their fellow citizens, they found that few professions were as selfless and rewarding as this noble pursuit. Orcish culture, more particularly their relationship with wealth, is such that they are remarkably resistant to corruption. Elders within their society hold little interest in accumulating riches, while their younger counterparts perceive bribery and similar methods of obtaining coin as dishonorable and disrespectful. To accept such offerings is to admit one's own inability to acquire wealth, an affront to the self-reliance that orcs value so dearly. Such resolution against the allure of corruption has led numerous elder orcs to occupy advisory positions within the political and religious institutions of the city. Their counsel, untainted by the temptations of material gain, springs from an earnest desire to assist and guide those in need, thus, their wisdom is sought and valued by those who recognize the purity of their intentions and the absence of ulterior motives."

										"In the distant past, far beyond the reach of memory, the Orcs were a nomadic tribe, roaming vast expanses of hostile lands, yearning for a better future. Driven by their insatiable desire for wealth, they engaged in both trade and plunder, amassing a treasure trove of knowledge and resources. These nomadic Orcs were known for their barbaric and greedy nature, as they pursued their fortunes with little regard for others.",
										"In the course of their wanderings, the Orcs discovered the burgeoning city-state of Luyarnha. Nestled in a strategic location, blessed with fertile soil and abundant water, teeming with opportunities, and importantly, protected from the reach of the human kingdoms\u2014who had developed a hatred of goblinoids\u2014the city held a magnetic allure for the enterprising Orcs. They recognized that plundering and ransacking Luyarnha would lead to their inevitable destruction, as the might of the city-state would crush them and eradicate their kind from the world. Thus, a majority of them opted to suppress their barbaric instincts, hoping to transform their nomadic existence into a stable and prosperous civilization within Luyarnha's walls, whilst the rest of them continued in their journeys.",
										"Initially, the Orcs' arrival in Luyarnha was met with suspicion by the native population, who had labored tirelessly to build their city and would not let outsiders reduce it to ashes. However, as the city's denizens observed the Orcs' indomitable spirit and keen intellect, their apprehension gave way to acceptance. The Orcs soon became an integral part of Luyarnha's tapestry, contributing to its growth and development. Their presence served as a catalyst for change, inspiring the city to treat outsiders with greater respect, acknowledging the potential value they could bring.",
										"The Orcs' decision to remain within Luyarnha was further solidified by the ascension of the Radiant Church. Prior to its establishment, many Orcs resided in the city solely to satisfy their mercantile ambitions, yet they harbored a profound spiritual yearning. The teachings of the Radiant Church resonated with their longing for a higher purpose, offering a means to reconcile their cursed avarice with the pursuit of virtue. The Orcs embraced this newfound faith, and many devoted themselves to the service of the Radiant Church, finding solace and redemption in its hallowed halls.",
										"Thus, the Orcs became a part of Luyarnha's history and identity. Their influence pervaded every aspect of the city's life, from the bustling marketplaces to the grand cathedrals, and their story became inextricably linked with that of the city they now called home. As they adapted to their new surroundings, the once-barbaric and greedy Orcs found a way to channel their innate desires towards the greater good, forever changing the course of their destiny."

The first attack against a lunar revenant was ordered by the Radiant Church, in a misguided attempt to quell the tale of their existence. That night, dozens of hunters perished to bring down a single revenant, a sacrifice none were ready to pay.

						"The term \"Fallen Hunter\" refers to those hunters who, tragically, have fallen prey to the scourge that afflicts Luyarnha. They represent the unfortunate reality of the struggles faced by those who dedicate their lives to hunting the monstrous and the vile.",
						"Importantly, it's worth noting that, while these scourge-claimed hunters are numerous, they are not all simultaneously active, or even alive, within Luyarnha. If they were, the city would have crumbled long ago. The Fallen Hunters detailed in this book are specifically designed to serve as named antagonists \u2014potential villains who can add depth and challenge to a campaign. The stronger the original hunter, the stronger the transformed form.",
						"However, despite their fearsome nature, the Fallen Hunters present an interesting divergence from many of the adversaries heroes may face. They hold the hope for redemption. This concept of potential redemption is key in defining their role in the world of Luyarnha. It offers unique storytelling opportunities, and it can shape narrative arcs in a campaign in compelling ways.",
						"Such redemption might take the form of a miraculous recovery driven by the heroes, restoring them to their former self, free from the scourge's insidious grasp. Alternatively, it might present itself as an opportunity for a Fallen Hunter to engage in one final act of defiance against the dark forces corrupting Luyarnha\u2014or in the case of those who haven't completely lost their sanity, the opportunity to give them a new goal and a new hope to fight once more. In either case, these narrative paths allow for Fallen Hunters to be more than just adversaries; they can be tragic figures, symbols of resilience, and catalysts for emotionally charged moments.",

While traditional adventures offer excitement, challenges, and epic tales of heroism, adding layers of horror can transform a campaign into a deeply immersive and emotionally charged experience.

These disparate tales, coupled with the unnerving absence of sacred songs, subtly point to the looming shadow of Seraphel, suggesting he's the malevolent force now echoing through the silent halls of the Grand Cathedral."
