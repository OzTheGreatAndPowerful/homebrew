							"To a skavarot, life is a complex web of plots and intrigues designed by his enemies for the sole purpose of harming him and him only. A cautious skavarot, however, never attracts more attention than is necessary, for fear of becoming a tempting target for an upstart underling or a suspicious superior. It is common for skavarot to show their superiority towards their underlings by showering them with shrill abuse on a regular basis. These actions are as much as to inflate a skavarot's ego as to deter potential rivals. Thus, while the failures of a skavarot are due to the weaknesses or the machinations of others, their achievements are nevertheless the result of his own incredible talents. To a skavarot, if a group assault decimates the enemy, it would be thanks to his brilliant planning. If a skavarot horde emerges in the right place, it is thanks to his genius that they have discovered the right path. Whether it's the right time, the right place, or the perfect weather, a skavarot would always believe that he is a master of strategy, logistics and politics beyond anyone else in the entire Under-Empire."
