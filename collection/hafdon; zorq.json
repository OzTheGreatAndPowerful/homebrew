Instead, they stalk the forest floor, lurk in narrow ravines or shallow caves, or hide in ruined sites while waiting for prey to come near. A girallon is surprisingly stealthy, considering its size and its lack of camouflage.",

Each individual typically hunts alone and widely separated from the others, to ensure that everyone gets adequate fodder. The leader might organize members to work together to make a big kill.

If one is taken young and properly trained, a girallon could end up in a seemingly unlikely place, such as guarding the entrance to a city's thieves' guild.

After this time, the rot grub is too far under the host creature's skin to be burned. If a creature infested by one or more herg worms ends its turn with 0 hit points, it dies as the grubs burrow into its heart and kill it.
