A {@condition frightened} creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of its turn, ending the effect on itself on a success.",

The first time you use this ability, you suffer no adverse effects. If you use it again before completing a short or long rest, you take {@damage 1d4} necrotic damage. Each additional time you use it before finishing a rest, the necrotic damage increases by {@dice 1d4}."

As you focus your study on void speech, you learn to properly invoke the words and glyphs to empower your magic and to tap the vast potential of the void.",
