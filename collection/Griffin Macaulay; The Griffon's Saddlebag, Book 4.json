                    "This crossbow's wood shifts from golden yellows to vibrant reds and has a dimly lit fuse at its top. It has 6 charges and regains {@dice 1d6} expended charges daily at dawn. You can expend 1 of the weapon's charges once on each of your turns when you make a ranged attack roll with it. When you do, the bolt sizzles and sparks with festive colors, and whistles loudly as it flies through the air. On a hit, the target takes an extra {@damage 2d10} fire damage. Hit or miss, the bolt then explodes in an eruption of magical fireworks. The target of the attack and each creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take {@damage 1d10} fire damage and be under the effects of the {@spell faerie fire} spell until the start of your next turn (no {@status concentration} required). The whistling bolt and firework's explosion can be heard out to a range of 300 feet. The bolt is then destroyed, provided it wasn't magical."
