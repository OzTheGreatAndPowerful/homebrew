An atlatl is comprised of a handle with a cup or spur at the end into which a dart, greater trident, harpoon, javelin, spear, trident, or yklwa may be set, either at its butt or at a notched point on the shaft. When such a weapon is launched from an atlatl, both its range increments are increased by a distance equal to the weapon's normal range increment. Alternately, the atlatl can be used to throw grenades or vials, doubling their ranges. Using an atlatl requires two hands. Because of the time required to attach the thrown weapon to this device, you can throw only one projectile with it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make."
