               "As an action, you can speak aloud a word or short phrase in void speech. One creature of your choice within 10 feet that can hear you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against this magic (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be {@condition frightened} of you for 1 minute. A {@condition frightened} creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of its turn, ending the effect on itself on a success.",
               "Other creatures who can hear you suffer minor reactions to the void speech such as spontaneous nosebleeds, headaches, bits of hair falling out, and other unsettling effects. The first time you use this ability, you suffer no adverse effects. If you use it again before completing a short or long rest, you take {@damage 1d4} necrotic damage. Each additional time you use it before finishing a rest, the necrotic damage increases by {@dice 1d4}."
