The three books form the complete set of books for gamemasters to run dark fantasy and horror campaigns in the Grim Hollow setting.",
								"The Grim Hollow setting takes place in a world known as Etharis, a dark and gritty environment where the vicious, terrible, horrifying monsters that hide in the shadowy alleyways and remote wildernesses are only the start of the peril. As much as the monsters of the world threaten the citizenry, the dark figures that entice those who seek power are just as dangerous. Blood magic, undeath, lycanthropy, fey magic, fell sorcery, and other temptations: would-be heroes are always one wrong step away from becoming the villains they claim to fight."

Gore, child endangerment, loss of free will, nightmares: all of these and more infest these pages.",

These rules encourage a type of play that invites characters to make the most of their knowledge and proficiencies, as well as their downtime, in order to have the best chance of surviving the threats they face. The blood, bones, brains, and bile of the creatures they kill might provide characters with advantages later. Weapons, potions, components, and other magic items might not be readily available, but the characters can make their own from salvaged parts of monsters. And in some cases, monsters might be nigh invulnerable unless the characters use their wits."

Local legends about a beast may be myth or folly, but even within the malarky there could be an iota of truth\u2014and that truth could be the difference between surviving an encounter and suffering an ultimate defeat.",
								"The ability checks associated with each monster are meant to provide details on what a character might know about a monster\u2014or what a character might find out. Use these checks to dole out important information. Some checks might require characters to do some research, or even face the creature to observe its traits and behavior. Failed checks could result in characters gaining incorrect or partial bits of information, which could lead to dire consequences."

With the zeal of a censorious bureaucratic tyrant, they now wage a guerilla war with a piecemeal retinue of veteran battle angels, zealots, fanatic paladins, cohorts of penitent levies, and volunteer convert militia auxiliaries as part of an anti-corruption peasant revolt in the hinterland of Altenheim."

														"Illusions. Enchantments. Necromancy. Conjurations. There's no denying the varied and terrible methods that arcanists might use to wreak their corrupted havoc on the innocent sheep. The only force standing between the population and vile arcanists are us. Striking down the users of magic is one step in our plan, but we also have to understand how magic affects our charges, and how to break the magical bonds that they often find themselves shackled by."

														"One rotten arcanist in a community might seem like a small threat, but like a similarly rotten apple, within days the entire bushel basket is corrupted if the rot is not discovered and eliminated quickly. Unlike an apple, however, discovering a rotten soul is much more difficult. Fortunately, our Inquisition have tools at our disposal that allow us to ferret out that rot. Once it's discovered through our use of the will of Empyreus, then more mundane tools are at our disposal. Assuming, of course, that you consider a very sharp blade applied to a neck as a mundane tool."
