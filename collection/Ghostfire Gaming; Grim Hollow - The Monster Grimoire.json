The three books form the complete set of books for gamemasters to run dark fantasy and horror campaigns in the Grim Hollow setting.",
								"The Grim Hollow setting takes place in a world known as Etharis, a dark and gritty environment where the vicious, terrible, horrifying monsters that hide in the shadowy alleyways and remote wildernesses are only the start of the peril. As much as the monsters of the world threaten the citizenry, the dark figures that entice those who seek power are just as dangerous. Blood magic, undeath, lycanthropy, fey magic, fell sorcery, and other temptations: would-be heroes are always one wrong step away from becoming the villains they claim to fight."

Gore, child endangerment, loss of free will, nightmares: all of these and more infest these pages.",

These rules encourage a type of play that invites characters to make the most of their knowledge and proficiencies, as well as their downtime, in order to have the best chance of surviving the threats they face. The blood, bones, brains, and bile of the creatures they kill might provide characters with advantages later. Weapons, potions, components, and other magic items might not be readily available, but the characters can make their own from salvaged parts of monsters. And in some cases, monsters might be nigh invulnerable unless the characters use their wits."

Local legends about a beast may be myth or folly, but even within the malarky there could be an iota of truth\u2014and that truth could be the difference between surviving an encounter and suffering an ultimate defeat.",
								"The ability checks associated with each monster are meant to provide details on what a character might know about a monster\u2014or what a character might find out. Use these checks to dole out important information. Some checks might require characters to do some research, or even face the creature to observe its traits and behavior. Failed checks could result in characters gaining incorrect or partial bits of information, which could lead to dire consequences."

In the early centuries, Gegazol was a living dragon, many say an offspring of the Prismatic Wyrm Gormadraug. She lived, that is, until she attacked a daemon. The battle was ferocious, as the dragon and fiend fought for life. Gegazol won, tearing the fiend in half, but her victory had a price. As the daemon's ichor flowed upon the dragon, it killed and later cursed her body with the filth of undeath. Gegazol raged at her reawakening and proceeded to tear at and destroy her own undead body, only to reform later near the body of the vanquished daemon. The skull of the demon acts as the dragon's soul vessel.",

The battle was ferocious, as the dragon and fiend fought for life. Gegazol won, tearing the fiend in half, but her victory had a price. As the daemon's ichor flowed upon the dragon, it killed and later cursed her body with the filth of undeath. Gegazol raged at her reawakening and proceeded to tear at and destroy her own undead body, only to reform later near the body of the vanquished daemon. The skull of the demon acts as the dragon's soul vessel.",

Once an ithjar locates a potential meal, the ithjar flies in a strange, swirling fashion, reminiscent of a long-tailed kite. As the ithjar closes in, that curious flying pattern becomes a whirlwind of violence and death.",

								"Ithjar teeth and hide can fetch a fair price in larger markets. Necklaces and other decorations can be made from the teeth, and clothing can be fashioned from the skin and scales. Popular superstition says wearing ithjar teeth or hide imparts some of the creature's nimbleness to the wearer. This belief isn't wholly true, but someone who has proficiency with {@item leatherworker's tools|PHB} can make hide armor from the hide that has a base AC of 13 and allows a wearer to apply their full Dexterity bonus to AC. Creating this armor takes 10 days. Such hide armor fashioned from a stormborn ithjar is armor of resistance (lightning and thunder). This armor takes no longer to make, but it requires other materials worth 2,000 gp.",

A creature hit by the javelin must also succeed on a {@dc 13} Strength saving throw or fall {@condition prone}. Someone who has proficiency with {@item smith's tools|PHB} can make this weapon with 10 days of work and other materials worth 250 gp. Somebody must also cast {@spell thunderwave} on the weapon three times during its creation."
