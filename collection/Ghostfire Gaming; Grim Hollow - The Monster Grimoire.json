The three books form the complete set of books for gamemasters to run dark fantasy and horror campaigns in the Grim Hollow setting.",
								"The Grim Hollow setting takes place in a world known as Etharis, a dark and gritty environment where the vicious, terrible, horrifying monsters that hide in the shadowy alleyways and remote wildernesses are only the start of the peril. As much as the monsters of the world threaten the citizenry, the dark figures that entice those who seek power are just as dangerous. Blood magic, undeath, lycanthropy, fey magic, fell sorcery, and other temptations: would-be heroes are always one wrong step away from becoming the villains they claim to fight."

Gore, child endangerment, loss of free will, nightmares: all of these and more infest these pages.",
								"The previous Grim Hollow books talk about safety tools and methods you can use to ensure that everyone involved in your game is having a good time and avoiding problematic material.

These rules encourage a type of play that invites characters to make the most of their knowledge and proficiencies, as well as their downtime, in order to have the best chance of surviving the threats they face. The blood, bones, brains, and bile of the creatures they kill might provide characters with advantages later. Weapons, potions, components, and other magic items might not be readily available, but the characters can make their own from salvaged parts of monsters. And in some cases, monsters might be nigh invulnerable unless the characters use their wits."

Local legends about a beast may be myth or folly, but even within the malarky there could be an iota of truth\u2014and that truth could be the difference between surviving an encounter and suffering an ultimate defeat.",
								"The ability checks associated with each monster are meant to provide details on what a character might know about a monster\u2014or what a character might find out. Use these checks to dole out important information. Some checks might require characters to do some research, or even face the creature to observe its traits and behavior. Failed checks could result in characters gaining incorrect or partial bits of information, which could lead to dire consequences."

Her diligent study of Empyreus' dogma earned her the privilege of joining the Inquisition's ranks at fourteen years old. Over the course of her first years in the Arcanist Inquisition, Abree's faith was unwavering. When her superiors directed her to root out corruption, she did so with meticulous fervor When asked to put fire to the kindling beneath accused spellcasters, she did so without hesitation. Then she was deployed to the village where she and her brother had been raised by distant family following the death of their parents. She discovered her brother was accused of casting magic. Her unit was charged with incarcerating him until his trial and execution."

If anyone among the player characters is an inquisitor, she changes her plans and asks if they could vouch for her so she can return to her post. Regardless, if the player characters agree to assist Abree in keeping her safe from the Inquisition, she happily travels with and fights alongside them."

In the early centuries, Gegazol was a living dragon, many say an offspring of the Prismatic Wyrm Gormadraug. She lived, that is, until she attacked a daemon. The battle was ferocious, as the dragon and fiend fought for life. Gegazol won, tearing the fiend in half, but her victory had a price. As the daemon's ichor flowed upon the dragon, it killed and later cursed her body with the filth of undeath. Gegazol raged at her reawakening and proceeded to tear at and destroy her own undead body, only to reform later near the body of the vanquished daemon. The skull of the demon acts as the dragon's soul vessel.",

										"There's a saying that Gegazol and the icy north share the same birthday. For as long as the Valikan Clans have told tales, their stories spoke of Gegazol's rage\u2014though none who live have seen her. In the early centuries, Gegazol was a living dragon, many say an offspring of the Prismatic Wyrm Gormadraug. She lived, that is, until she attacked a daemon. The battle was ferocious, as the dragon and fiend fought for life. Gegazol won, tearing the fiend in half, but her victory had a price. As the daemon's ichor flowed upon the dragon, it killed and later cursed her body with the filth of undeath. Gegazol raged at her reawakening and proceeded to tear at and destroy her own undead body, only to reform later near the body of the vanquished daemon. The skull of the demon acts as the dragon's soul vessel.",
										"There's an essential link between Gegazol and the daemon skull. Whenever the dragon's undead body is destroyed, it reconstitutes dramatically. First, the stained bones appear, followed by the rotten muscle, tattered flesh, rotting teeth, and a maggot-infested tongue. Gegazol is helpless in this transformation. She can't touch the skull\u2014subtle enchantments steer her away. Gegazol has lost track of how many times she's been restored near the skull."

										"To Gegazol, her mind is her own, but deep down, something else swirls. The daemon's psychic essence intermingled with the dragon's consciousness when her body became undead. The daemon's essence either refuses to or is incapable of communicating with any creature. It can't speak; the skull is silent. Its mind can't be reached via magic."

White or oko quoxxaries resemble a pale, disease-ridden corpse, with a pestilential cloud hanging around it. The creatures appear weak, prone to stumbling and coughing, but they are as supernaturally sickening as their appearance suggests. Gray or boza quoxxaries are the rarest and most powerful, and they are also the most patient and circumspect in battle. A gray quoxxarie is skeletal, its ashy skin stretched tight over the bones, its desiccated organs giving off dust. This fiend brings pain and death with it, causing wounds to fester and refuse to heal. A gray quoxxarie prefers foes that are close to death."
