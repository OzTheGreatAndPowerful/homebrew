They have been irrevocably changed by their far-reaching dreams of conquest and their loyalty to Red Wizards and the greater glory of Thay itself. The raw power of the Weave, the fundamental arcane fabric that powers all magic across the Forgotten Realms, courses through the paladin and provides the lens through which they perceive the world. The protection and promotion of magic is their sworn goal, and they will go to any length to achieve it.",

The secret of creating a weavebound paladin was until recently known only to Szass Tam, but others around the realms\u2014notably the Blackstaff in Waterdeep and Zulkir Dar'lon Ma of Mulmaster\u2014have begun to craft their own versions of this path. Still, there are those wary few across the Sword Coast and beyond who believe that Szass Tam merely leaked a corrupt version of the ritual into the world so that he might have more eyes and ears where he needs them most: adjacent to the most powerful casters that he does not already control.",

								"Well met, reader!",
								"Ye hold a tome both vitally necessary for those seeking to trade with the Land of the Red Wizards, and perilous to pen. Thayans of any era, from Thayd to the recent and all-roo-ruthless reign of that overreaching fool Szass Tam, are sensitive about anyone who reveals too much of their true nature and doings to outlanders.",
								"Fortunately, not only are the creative folk who've produced this book bold and inquisitive sorts, who've laid bare before ye more secrets of Thay than have ever before been assembled between any pair of covers, but I am also bold, inquisitive, and an overreaching fool to boot, so I will happily add to what they've written. So what shall I tell ye of Thay?",
								"Well, to begin, the average Thayan laborer and shopkeeper wants undamaged wares, and whole items; not for them the bolt of cloth from a distant land, to be cut and sewn, or a stack of tool-handles, for them to fit onto hammer-heads or pickheads or the like; they want to buy a whole and finished item.",
								"This same \"everyday\" Thayan likely hums tunes to themselves, short little melodies or harmonies playing on melodies they already know, and is likely to overhear other Thayans doing this as they work and travel\u2014with the result that these little tunes sweep the land. So don't go whistling or humming ditties to act nonchalant, or as code for traveling companions\u2014or ye may attract attentive interest from nearby Thayans, when ye'd rather not have it.",
								"This same everyday Thayan may well have a habit of chewing a weed that grows everywhere in Thay for the plucking; most do. The weed is thulfraz, and it looks like a spider on its back: eight dark green, thin stems sprouting from a central root-knob. Lemony-minty and yet a little like parsley, too. Thayans often chew as they work, like a cow masticating its cud.",
								"And when they're not chewing, they're drinking. Not always something strong, more often during the working day (dawn to dusk for most, mind ye) it'll be tea, hot or cold, and that tea will be elkammat. (Which is the standard drinking tea of the eastern Inner Sea, from Aglarond and Thay to the Vilhon; a brown, nutty tea brewed from the fibrous husks of groundnuts in Murghôm, Semphar, Mulhorand, Unther, and Chondath; woody and bitter, but usually sold \"adorned\" with subtle additions of spices like cinnamon and nutmeg, and the right mix of these can make it delightful.)",
								"And at meals, they need to drink something to cool the throat, as many of them drown their dishes in tart, fiery tamarind-dominated brown sauces, and marinade their fish and their fowl before cooking.",
								"Oh, and so used are Thayans to being spied upon by Red Wizards and their agents\u2014and if not that, spies for local tharchions and tharchionesses\u2014that everyone puts their heads together to share gossip, low-voiced. It's just become habit, and generations ago, so now they do it from birth without thinking.",
								"And ye may hear them call on Kossuth, for they daily purify household things, like needles and metal dishes that have been used to mix herbal remedies, by holding them in flame as they murmur, \"Antur daeya KOSSUTH\" in Thorass (\"Be here, to aid with your power, Kossuth\").",
								"And speaking of the gods, ye'll search in vain for an in-use public temple or shrine to, say, Mystra, but there are plenty of hidden family chapels (that non-family-members will not be invited into, nor will anyone formally confirm their existence), to all deities, for Thayans venerate (even if only to ward off disfavor, in small daily ways, like \"don't let dinner be burned\" or \"let no crockery be broken in this move\") all the gods. In the cities of Thay, Thayans find comfort in shared rituals of devotion. The sparsely-populated frontier tharches have small, simple unstaffed wayside shrines here and there, used for personal worship of whoever matters most to a Thayan praying there. The city of Eltabbar is the heart of religious power in Thay, the place where powerful clerics indulge in intrigues and endlessly refine and debate policy. Decrees go out from the highest-ranking priests in Eltabbar to everywhere else in Thay, because Eltabbar is where they meet, and where most of them dwell (when they're not living in their mansions in Thaymount, or elsewhere in Thay on holy business).",
								"Yet enough of the everyday; I've been told by the likes of Volo the Halfwit that readers thirst for adventure, so perhaps I'd best mention some of the thefts and treasure tales and unsolved mysteries of Thay that may yet spawn adventures. Some of which may even be survivable.",
								"So let it first be said that in the mountains that bound Thay to the east, that have variously been called the Sunrise Mountains or the Sunset Mountains\u2014 very Thayan, that; in rulership, they can't keep to one decision for long\u2014there are many tombs full of long-hidden magic. Enchanted items, that dead mages of early Thay were interred wearing, and whose magics have often transformed the dead into undead\u2014 lich-like, spellwielding unique undead, many of them. These are small tombs of a few chambers gouged out of cave walls, not grand buildings. A good thing, too, for even Red Wizards aren't quite so proudly unobservant and stupid as to not notice surface structures just sitting there.",
								"There's also the Whispering Ghost, which is an undead spirit actually more akin to a vampiric mist than what we usually call a \"ghost.\" Or rather, scores of such spirits, not a lone entity. Once they decide ye will make a good means of helping them become more powerful than they are, they hound ye, whispering to ye in dreams and when ye're alone, to try to goad ye into doing things that will aid them. They'll feed on others, but not ye, unless ye repudiate or try determinedly to destroy them. Many a Thayan is the driven tool of such a spirit, but they seem to seize upon visiting outlanders with especial eagerness.",
								"It would be remiss of me not to mention a somewhat similar whisperer, this one a lone lady: Qulone Trythkul\u2014that's \"koo-LOAN Trithh-KOOL\"\u2014who has passed into undeath. She was Szass Tam's lover, or one of them, long ago, and he tired of her and tricked her to her doom by getting her to retrieve for him a magical scepter whose touch ate living flesh. She wasted away after delivering it to him, but Tam overreached once more, for he'd not realized the scepter's magic would enmesh with the lady's own worn enchanted items, dissolving them but making her undead in the process as their magic sank into her very bones. She exists now to get her revenge on Tam, and may whisper to the living not just to do things that may harm him or his schemes, but also to aid them in escaping his minions and vengeance. Qulone's whispered counsel has rescued many outlanders and Thayan rebels alike from doom.",
								"And then there are the forgotten underways of Bezantur, where many of its magnificent temples were built atop the extensive cellars of grand noble mansions that were simply covered over with rubble\u2014 entombing all manner of creatures and wares, until inquisitive Underdark denizens tunneled up into them from beneath. Most of them still lie dark and waiting under the city's cobbles, and their own thick layers of dust, holding fistfuls of gems and only long-dead Thayan servants know what else.",
								"Yet I'll ramble for pages and pages, given the slightest opportunity, and it's not me ye've come for! 'Tis the splendor of Thay.",
								"So read on, and until next we meet on some page or other,",
								"Yours in the service of Mystra,"

						"Thay. The name invokes images of an evil nation, bent on conquering the surrounding kingdoms and subjugating them to their will. It brings to mind vibrant imagery of massive undead armies, explosive magics, and demons shackled by profane rituals to perform the will of their vile masters.",
						"But this isn't entirely correct. While Thay is led by a group of evil mages, it is also home to thousands of innocent, hard-working people. The nation is perceived to be evil, but as with all things, perception is based only upon what people are allowed to witness. Those who explore Thay often find that it is filled with gentle, peaceful people that are content to fill their days with crafting and family. However, these people are still bound to their leaders and labor under the ever-present risks associated with their vicious leaders.",

								"The people of Thay are primarily human, but other races find homes here as well. Even those races that are typically considered monstrous, such as goblins and bugbears, may be able to establish homes in some of the tharches (states) of Thay. They are a hardworking people, mainly focused on their daily tasks, and only rarely do they plan into the future beyond satisfying the needs of their children.",
								"Each of the tharches are given greater detail elsewhere in this supplement, but the general essence of Thay is that the people are honest and reliable, but labor under the oppressive yoke of a totalitarian arcane regime. The zulkirs that rule the nation place their desires and goals above those of the people, and while each of the rulers do desire to promote and protect Thay, nothing is as important as themselves.",
								"Unlike previous years, the worship of deities other than {@deity Mystra|Faerûnian|SCAG} is now permitted in Thay. Each tharch claims influence from a small number of deities, with most people across the nation revering some mix of {@deity Chauntea|Faerûnian|SCAG}, {@deity Gond|Faerûnian|SCAG}, {@deity Mystra|Faerûnian|SCAG}, and {@deity Waukeen|Faerûnian|SCAG}. In a surprisingly supportive move by several of the tharches, the recognition and even the worship of the {@language Mulhorandi|SCAG} pantheon has become commonplace.",

										"Nearly all of the citizens of Thay are of two main ethnic groups. The Mulani comprise the bulk of the bureaucracy and aristocracy. The Rashemi are the other primary group; they tend to be burlier and shorter than the Mulani.",
										"Mulani Thayans are raised to obey the laws of Thay, revere Red Wizards and especially the zulkirs and Szass Tam above all, and believe they are an integral part of the most powerful and advanced realm in the world. Thanks to their upbringing, many tend to be arrogant, especially towards non-humans. Many Mulani view such as elves and halflings as equivalent to children, while gnomes and dwarves are often despised or driven away under pain of death. Other races like orcs, half-orcs, and centaurs are tolerated so long as the Mulani believe that they can be employed as useful, strong-backed individuals.",
										"A typical Mulani is tall and thin with brown or hazel eyes, deep yellow through brown to, in very rare circumstances, almost slate-gray skin. They have very little natural black or dark brown body hair, which they are generally expected to keep closely shaved. As a result of a drought in Thay's past, the people typically oil any remaining hair that they have and bathe in scented oils that are later scraped off the body along with any dirt.",
										"Many Thayans bear intricate tattoos whose patterns reflect their goals and accomplishments. Similarly, Red Wizards often have many tattoos signifying marks of mastery and prestige, but these are often far more detailed than those a Mulani Thayan might dare to acquire without truthfully earning them. While such intricate tattoos were almost always limited to men in the past, such a taboo is no longer present and all people are free to demonstrate their designs and accomplishments via tattoos.",

										"Thayans hate and fear others of magical might, especially when those people come from the neighboring nations of Rashemen or Aglarond. Far-off locations such Halruaa and Calimshan are also viewed as opposition at least and vile enemies of Thay at worst. Thayans have been taught to view these people as foes to be thwarted and denigrated whenever possible, and ignored and not spoken of the rest of the time.",
										"Mulani Thayans make up most of the bureaucracy and upper class within Thay, and look down on Rashemi commoners. Zulkirs, tharchions and tharchionesses, and senior bureaucrats (sometimes referred to as Thaen) tend to be drawn from the ranks of the Mulani, first from the most financially successful, long-powerful, and haughty families like the houses of Cathyl, Iryleian, Thrond, and Valakkar, and secondly from individuals of outstanding personal drive and merit. As a result, there are very few lazy, corrupt, or incompetent administrators in Thay; those in power are efficient, insightful, and quick to act with precision.",
										"The bulk of Thay's citizens, the shopkeepers and skilled laborers and overseers of most slave workteams in the realm, are of Rashemi stock: short, burly, muscular, hairy-bodied people with thick black hair, dark eyes, and light to dark brown skin. Unlike Rashemi in Rashemen and elsewhere, Thayan Rashemi shave their heads to emulate Mulani Thayans. Thayan Rashemi see themselves as the true heart and core of Thay's greatness, carrying the realm upon their backs and doing the work that is truly necessary\u2014for the Mulani lack the skills to properly feed themselves, build or make anything, or really function; all they know is how to decide and lead and boss others around, and so they are nothing without us to do the real work for them. This engenders not so much resentment of Mulani as a deep pride that we the workers are pulling Thay forward and ever upward, to brighter greatness."

										"Historically, Thay was a magocracy. The nation was headed by a ruling Council of Zulkirs who pursued ever-greater mastery of the Art and left military matters\u2014such as the frequent invasions of Aglarond, Rashemen, and other neighboring lands\u2014and administration of the daily life of the country to the noble tharchions and tharchionesses of districts of Thay (tharches). Today, however, Thay has become a dictatorship that is ruled by the undead lich Szass Tam, a tyrant who largely dictated policy to the Council of Zulkirs and appointed Red Wizards to it who would obey him.",
										"Despite his increasingly erratic and failed attempts to achieve godhood or at least far greater power, the beliefs of High Regent Szass Tam\u2014that the pursuit of greater mastery of the Art was the supreme aim in any existence, and that achieving undeath was the best way to do so, as it opened a personal portal to limitless power and opportunities\u2014have over time come to permeate Thayan society and thinking.",
										"Those Thayan citizens who have the aptitude to wield arcane magic become Red Wizards, and ruthlessly vie for advancement and power through diligent service to the High Regent, often in intrigues and mercantile schemes all across Faerûn.",
										"Those who lack the Gift for wielding the Art see no reward for them in Thay. Lichdom is offered only to natural-born masters of the Art, so their only benefit is the privilege of being a citizen; while this enables them to have a chance to accumulate wealth or petty local power, it simply fails to satisfy the deep and ravenous appetites that most Thayans possess.",
										"Over the passing years, whether supreme authority rested in the hands of Szass Tam or the Council, the social order in Thay below the rank of Zulkir remained much the same, though the true authority of tharchions was steadily eroding. The Red Wizards are on top, with their own hierarchy descending from Zulkir and their spies and enforcers to senior mages of each school, then the rank-and-file experienced mages, down through the novices.",
										"Below the Red Wizards come the rest of the nobility: the Mulani tharchions, bureaucrats, sages, priests, and the richest merchant families, the houses who invest in the businesses of lesser merchants and are landlords to most Thayans dwelling in cities. Beneath these are the military commanders and veteran soldiers of Thay, who may or may not be Mulani nobles, for over time Thay has learned the hard way to reward merit and experience in their military.",
										"Then come the rest of the merchants, enjoying a status in society commensurate with their personal wealth, influence, and achievements. Engineers and owners of forges and construction materials and warehouses rank highly, mingled among the best artisans and craftworkers. Beneath them stand the most successful shopkeepers, more than a few of whom own chains of outlets, and proprietors of currently-popular city eateries. This middle class are Mulani, Rashemi, and mixed-lineage humans, and at the bottom of it are apprentices, skilled laborers, and crafters.",
										"Then come the lower class, semi-skilled workers and common laborers, bodyguards and shop and warehouse guards, and loaders and drovers, who might be of any Thayan-tolerated race, including obvious outlanders. Some are citizens but most are not.",
										"Finally, underpinning everything in Thay, are the many, many slaves. Some through long service have won some measure of trust and are allowed to work under light or no supervision\u2014but slaves are never freed in Thay; they always belong to someone, and upon the death of an owner are inherited by someone else or seized by a creditor. In recent years it has become less acceptable to bring in new slaves, and even less palatable to have living slaves\u2014the upkeep simply isn't worth it in the minds of many of the eldest Thayans\u2014and so the market for undead servitors has been on the rise. This, coupled with a younger populace that is becoming more and more impactfully vocal about the need to prove Thay's value through direct action rather than on the backs of slaves may put the very concept of slave ownership in question.",

Almost every Thayan cook has family recipes for rathaek that they swear by, but although these vary widely in heat, they tend to be similar in overall flavor profile. Rarthaek is poured on a dish when it's ready to serve, and the \"iron-throated\" will even add more at the table for \"a good deep burn,\" but there are also kitchen sauces, or \"ulvurr,\" that begin as lemon juice and wine mixes, are thickened with what we would call a roux and a Thayan cook would call a \"dusult\" (\"Dusult it more\u2014that's a thin as a child's spit!

In our real world, these are usually called tajines or tagines, but they are always singular (tapering smoothly to a single chimney or spout). Thayan versions are called \"phalou\" (singular and plural are the same word), and consist of lipped bases (so a phalou placed over a metal dish will rest on its rim and also overlap it on the outside) of standard sizes, and straight edges so several can be placed touching each other down the length of a long metal cooking-dish (resulting in complete coverage, and a row of two or up to four parallel chimneys).",

										"Much of Thay's commerce is centered on trade. As the last major power ere travelers heading east from settled Faerûn cross the Sunrise Mountains and venture into the Endless Wastes or the wildlands of the Plains of Purple Dust and the Great Wild Wood, Thay controls the flow of goods in and out of the trade routes between the eastern and western lands. They also have significant influence in ports around the world, from Mulmaster to Baldur's Gate and beyond. Even fair Waterdeep has some amount of Thayan influence.",
										"The nation creates a significant amount of food exports as well. They offer large crops of wheat and corn every year, and several tharches are rich in berries and tomatoes. Thayan metallurgy is also highly sought after by collectors of fine wares, with Thayan-mined silver and gold pieces often fetching exorbitantly high prices due to the brilliant hues and level of purity found in these metals in their natural veins in Thay.",
										"Thay is well-known to the world at large as being the home of some of the most luxurious types of goats. Some of these breeds have coats as thick and voluminous as a sheep's fleece, others have intensely rich milk which is perfect for both consumption and soap-making, and a few offer a variety of meat that is so intensely delectable that it is said to cause a pleasant delirium upon completion of the meal.",
										"Nobles around the world often jump at the chance to acquire goat products from Thay, with a few merchants even going so far as to enter into franchise farm agreements with commercial farmers in Thay so that the breeds can be experienced the world over."

						"Take this wet mixture and stuff the cavity or cavities of the fowl with it (worry not if you have more than will fit, but discard this excess not), using the needles and the twine. If thy fowl retains its wings, tie them to the carcass so they'll burn not in the cooking.",
						"Mix thy oil with the leftover seasoning mix ye stuffed the fowl with (if ye have none, use pinches of salt and pepper) and coat the fowl with it, all over. If thy fowl is intact enough to have a breast side, place fowl pieces or whole bird breast side up on a roasting rack.",

						"During this time, gently warm the fowlsimmer near the hearthfire, so it spits not (it will, if used cold).",
						"When the color deepens sufficiently [after about an hour] turn the fowl over, and baste it with the fowlsimmer. Thereafter, baste several times, as you think it necessary [about every 30 minutes], but keep the remaining fowlsimmer, do not use it all.",
						"When the turned-over fowl has attained the same color as at first turning [so, about two hours into roasting], prick the legs and wings of the fowl [if any] with a fork to let the fat of the fowl fry the better.",
						"When the fowl sizzles and sings, if you wish to brown it, build up the fire around it [at the 3:45 mark of oven cooking, increase oven heat to 230℉ {@note 110℃}]. Move thy water to near enough the fire to heat, but not boil. Also move thy serving-platter near, to get warm.",

						"While it rests, take three small skins-worth [3 cups] of thy heated water and add to the remaining fowlsimmer, then strain this mix through a sieve.",
						"Now make ye the sauce. Wash, peel and halve the apple, core it and discard the core, and dice it. Peel the ginger and cut it up fine. Let thy sauce-portion of oil heat in thy second roasting-pan. When steam starts to rise from it, add the diced apple, ginger, cashew nuts, chestnuts, and cinnamon. Then stir once, and let fry for the length of a song [about 3 minutes]. Then pour in the sieved fowlsimmer-water mix, and build up the fire or move it to a hotter spot, to bring the pan contents to a boil. When the bubbles are hearty, stir in thy flour, and add salt and pepper to taste, and let boil hearty for less than half a song [about 1 minute], then take from heat. Let rest while ye carve the fowl, then use tongs to remove the cinnamon stick.",
						"On thy cutting surface, carve thy fowl, stuffing and all. Arrange on thy warmed platter and pour the sauce over it. (If platter not large enough for sauce, put sauce into pourer for diners to apply, but serve swiftly lest the fowl grow cold too soon.)"
