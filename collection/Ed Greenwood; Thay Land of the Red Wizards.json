They have been irrevocably changed by their far-reaching dreams of conquest and their loyalty to Red Wizards and the greater glory of Thay itself. The raw power of the Weave, the fundamental arcane fabric that powers all magic across the Forgotten Realms, courses through the paladin and provides the lens through which they perceive the world. The protection and promotion of magic is their sworn goal, and they will go to any length to achieve it.",

The secret of creating a weavebound paladin was until recently known only to Szass Tam, but others around the realms\u2014notably the Blackstaff in Waterdeep and Zulkir Dar'lon Ma of Mulmaster\u2014have begun to craft their own versions of this path. Still, there are those wary few across the Sword Coast and beyond who believe that Szass Tam merely leaked a corrupt version of the ritual into the world so that he might have more eyes and ears where he needs them most: adjacent to the most powerful casters that he does not already control.",

The Thayans, impressed with the creature's savagery, sought to duplicate its powers and might; their efforts would soon escape their grasp, though, as the goats they were experimenting upon escaped into the wilderness. Reportedly, only one now remains and those that have witnessed the aftermath of its passage believe this to be Bogmaw returned\u2014most people have no idea that the original {@creature hydra} is long gone and only this tormented monstrosity remains."
