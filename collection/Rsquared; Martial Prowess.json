						"A common complaint about martial combat in D&D is the gulf of power and utility that opens up between the warrior and the mage. While the wizard, cleric, and druid learn world-altering spells, the fighter swings his sword a few more times. Moreover, the metanalysis of weapon combat is largely solved, to the detriment of most of the weapon list. The tools in this document attempt to provide warriors with meaningful choices, options, and incentives to act outside 'I attack.' This is primarily a 'gamist' document, so while flavor elements are considered, it does not claim to fix combat to some imagined realistic or historical standard, or expand the weapon list for its own sake.",
						"Each set of rules is presented ala carte, so a DM may wish to make available only some of these pages or powers.",
						"The vanilla weapon list has duplication and weapons with no obvious value. The revised weapons table attempts to make a wider range of weapons compelling to warriors with varying properties and weapon-specific techniques reflecting specialized training in each weapon's unique advantages, without increasing the ceiling of martial damage.",
						"In 5E (and previous editions!), combat actions are often locked behind feats, which come around just every four levels, and compete with critical ability score improvements. The Combat Actions and Hit Die Actions section moots certain weak feats (Charger, Grappler) with situational actions, codifies DMG object damage guidelines for combat, and adds ways to do non-magical healing and status effect actions, expending hit dice instead of spell slots.",
						"Stances, an innovation in the 3E Tome of Battle, were an attempt to provide martial characters with passive bonuses during combat. Combat Stances replace 5E's Fighting Style feature with dynamic stances inspired by Unearthed Arcana and the Tome of Battle, advanced stances to provide a sense of progression, and rules for changing stances mid-combat.",
						"There might be concerns that additional maneuvers step on the Battlemaster's toes, but the Battlemaster adds effects and damage to his weapon attacks, while these techniques and special actions are used to as a substitute for an attack or action. For example, any character can Disarm, but only the Battlemaster can Disarming Attack. The final section vastly expands Battlemaster maneuvers with specializations - Cut-Throat, Mystic Knight, Savage, or Warlord - that represent a different approach to battlefield superiority, plus a standard maneuver group. Other fighters can gain limited access to these maneuvers, including more powerful techniques with level prerequisites to create a sense of progression."
