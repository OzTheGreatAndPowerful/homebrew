				"Mote beads are actually the {@ italic corpses} of {@monster motes}; they appear as tiny gold beads or grains that softly glow, shedding dim light in a 5-foot radius. In addition, if eaten, the bead provides one days sustenance for a Medium creature and heals 1 hit point. People capable of casting Healing spells will find more beads much more useful. A mote bead can be added as an optional material component (which will consume the Mote bead) to any Cure Wounds spell, adding a bonus as follows: Cure Wounds: the range becomes 30ft (The spell effectively becomes a ray Roll to hit with advantage against prone creatures. Healing Word: if cast immediately after the target takes damage, the healing effectively prevents the damage. Mass Cure Wounds: increase the healing by 1d8. Goodberry: each berry heals 2hp, and provides full day food and water."
