				"This trap consists of a severed Basilisk head, kept alive through magical means, affixed near some point of importance at roughly head height. Often disguised as decor, the severed head responds to the presence of intruders, fixing them with a {@creature basilisk|mm|basilisk's} stare. The trap is harmless to any individual averting their gaze, and the DC is 15 to spot it. Should a creature aware of the trap have prior experience with basilisks, they will be immediately understand the danger present. Otherwise, a creature may fail to realise the nature of the trap, and fall victim to the effects.",
				"A creature looking directly at the trap from within 30 ft. receives the effects of a {@creature basilisk|mm|basilisk's} Petrifying Gaze ability. The trap can only affect one creature at any given moment. As soon as a creature becomes petrified, the trap will switch its attention to another creature which is not paralyzed that it can see within 30 ft., if one exists."
