In such a setting, the DM may reward CP to characters that uphold the tenets of their faith in a grand way, or under extreme duress or whenever they take on one of the faith’s major enemies.

This might include anything from slaying an evil dragon when the rest of the group has fled to rescuing townsfolk from a burning building despite being terribly wounded. It does not have to be related to combat. Convincing the reticent king to send troops to help with a bandit problem or successfully jumping a wide chasm might earn a character a CP, depending on the circumstances.
