On a failure, you may steal any amount of time up to 1 year, causing the target to age and you to grow younger. Stealing more than 6 months from a target will grant you the effects of a long rest and result in them taking 1 level of exhaustion. When stealing 6 months or less, you gain the effects of short rest, and you can attempt to do so without the target being aware of the effect.

				"Perhaps you sought to make a pact with a regular patron and unknowingly entered a deal with the patron Gosoliad, or maybe you sought her intentionally. Once a powerful wizard living near the Shadelands, she sought to become a lich to extend her life. No one is sure how it happened or why, but the process of transferring her soul into the reliquary was interrupted, and she instead ascended, becoming a patron. Furiousat this unexpected resolution, she eventually tried to make the best of this newfound ascension until those seeking her power kept calling. An order of wizards began worshiping her, spreading the word of this glorious event, and sought to make pacts. Giving up some of herself and her power angered Gosolia",
				"She still found herself stuck in pact-after-pact evenas a Patron! It turns out, would-be-Warlocks were of-ten very charismatic, and she was anything but. Andso she spent countless years trying to find a way tostop them from seeking her out while trying to break the very deals she felt conned into brokering",
				"Finding a way to use the chaos of primal magic to shatter pacts and bonds that she made to these lesser beings, who could talk a good game, didn't earn Gosoliad any allies in the Shadelands. When they turned their ire to her followers or her, they quickly discovered she has mastered the art of neutralizing Warlocks. Majin was particularly pleased with the excess energy they gained each time Gosoliad broke pacts.",
				"Patrons decided to give Gosoliad what she wanted. Isolation. They leave her in peace and scourage others from speaking her name or seeking her, hoping she will fade in obscurity in her solitude before her influence destroys the system of pacts they partake in.",
				"Warlocks of the Broken Pact enter into a deal with Gosoliad, ofthen by having to trick her (or her followers) into making gain more power. Everyone knows she'll regret having to pay up her end of the deal later but htat pact breaking is what they really want anyway.",
				"With the creation of a symbolick reluquary like the one she used, they channel primal magic to break the pacts of others and disrupt both Warlock and traditional magic with its chaos energy. They do this under her guidance until she gets bored (level 10), and they have a level of mastery where they can channel these forces on their own, once again leaving Gosoliad to her solitude",
				"Once you have reached such a level, you will be revered and sought after by Warlocks to break pacts they wish to terminate and feared by powerful Warlocks who wants to keep their own. many members of the Legionnaires have walked this path to help others break their own pacts.",
