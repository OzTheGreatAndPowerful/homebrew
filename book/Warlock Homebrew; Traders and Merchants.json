Smelling profits on the wind, he ventures ever forward, seeking riches and glory for his clan.",

Concerned only with her writing, the halfling pays no heed to attracting customers. trusting that her books and reputation will be more than enough to entice passersby.",
						"Set against the edge of an alleyway. a male kobold clad only in a burlap sack waves his arms and chitters frantically, attempting to attract buyers. The kobold eventually gives up, sighing, glancing over towards his nearby pile of identical burlap sacks, complete with arm and head holes. No buyers today - but tomorrow, who knows?",
						"Though few of their ilk consider it. adventurers are far from being the only individuals enterprising and foolhardy enough to journey the wider world in search of fortune and glory. Merchants travel far and wide, often finding themselves at bustling hubs of business, such as port towns, trade hubs, and the more mercantile strongholds that pepper the disparate reaches of the world. Each merchant has their own motivations for and methods of pursuing free enterprise, and for every merchant just trying to get by, there's at least one more with fervant dreams of someday. somehow, making it big and retiring to comfort and fortune.",

This expansion is designed to work with the core {@loader Fortresses, Temples, & Strongholds|book/Warlock Homebrew; Fortresses, Temples, & Strongholds.json} option available at Warlock Homebrew, though these merchants can function equally well when found throughout the wider world.",
