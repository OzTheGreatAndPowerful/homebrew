						"Long, long ago (also known as January 2022, but it feels like a lot longer), James Introcaso and I were talking about our former careers\u2014mine as a software developer, his as a screenwriter for National Geographic writing, among other things, {@link songs about sharks|https://vimeo.com/102545202}. I joked that we should have him write a shark-focused article for {@i ARCADIA} ... to which he responded, \"My magnum opus. {@i SHARKADIA}.\"",
						"And thus {@i SHARKADIA} was born, a joke we not-so-secretly dreamed of making a reality. The MCDM team got on board, authors pitched many amazing ideas, and James was unleashed to write about fearsome sharks, friendly sharks, magic-guzzling sharks, weresharks, and more. Sharks galore!",
						"Sometimes committing to the bit as TTRPG designers means creating silly content perfect for a lighthearted one-shot or meme-inspired character. But in {@i ARCADIA}, we promise three articles a month of awesome, thoroughly tested stuff that you can use over and over again, and we wanted to deliver on that promise in {@i SHARKADIA}, too. There's lighthearted fun, yes, but part of committing to the bit for us is going all-out on substance inspired by nerdy topics outside of games. In this case, we took a deep dive into shark lore, pirate history, and deep-sea flora and fauna\u2014all with our own fantasy twist! The real world is vast and strange and wonderfully, endlessly inspiring.",
						"It also worked nicely to do aquatic content as part of a themed issue. Usually, each issue of {@i ARCADIA} presents three entirely separate articles so there's something for every campaign, but it's not easy to add sharks to your game unless the party has a good reason to go to sea, which requires your adventures to take a more oceanic spin. {@i One} aquatic article isn't as easy to use as {@i three} aquatic articles that give you a full set of monsters, companions, magic items, environments, quests, easy ship combat rules, random encounters, and more\u2014everything you need to make seafaring adventures part of your game.",
						"\"Captain Ralazar's Guide to Sea Monsters,\" by James Introcaso himself, is a fin-tastic feast of creatures and magic items documented by a legendary sailor, from the aranoth that absorbs memories to the warp shark whose tail can cut through reality. From Gwendolyn Marshall, \"Perils of the Deeps\" presents environmental conditions and challenges to make deep-sea adventuring feel properly perilous, plus five new monsters lurking in the depths, including the angler shark and dire jelly. And last but certainly not least, Willy Abeel brings us \"The Ballad of Captain Shivershank,\" an epic treasure trove of quest hooks, narrative seeds, and a memorable ally\u2014 or villain. With this piratical toolbox, you can create a swashbuckling campaign, story arc, or one-shot like no other.",
						"{@i SHARKADIA} has been a labor of love, committing to the bit and then some, and collaboratively enabling each other to reach new shark-inspired heights. We can't wait to hear about your adventures on the high seas and in the ocean depths.",

Such wonders need records, for Shipsnapper is hungry, and I know not if we will make it back to port to tell the tale.",
