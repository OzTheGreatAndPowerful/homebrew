						"The core principle of this crafting system is simplicity and specificity. Everything works with simple, easy to follow rules, but has enough depth to lift the burden from a GM having to fill in every blank by giving specific details for everything. While a GM is always the arbiter of what exists and if a crafting recipe works, by and large this system can be run with as much or as little input as a GM wants to add. It's a complete package that provides all the necessarily details for your players to get started\u2014and plenty of tables and guides for GMs as well.",

A +1 shortsword that no one can use could be the valuable basis of a new spear. Gems, gold, relics, and recyclables... all valid entry points for the crafter's creativity.",

Slowing down to a slow pass, he can make a gathering check with disadvantage, and attempts to gather reagents. Rolls the d100, and comes up with a 73. The GM asks for a DC 10 gathering check using herbalism kit, with disadvantage as they were travelling. Caius doesn't have proficiency, but has +1 wisdom, so needs a 9 or higher. He rolls a 14!",
								"The results in 1d4 common curative reagents. He rolls a 2. That's all the curative reagents he needed! He cleans out the remains of an old healing potion to get a glass vial, and next time they camp, he spends his camp action (2 hours) trying to make a healing potion.",

								"...He rolls a 3. This a failure! But all is not lost, he can keep trying until he fails 3 times in a row... but he's already spent his 2 hours, and alchemy checks must be made consecutively.",
								"Not wanting to lose his precious hard won reagents, he stays up late making another check. He rolls a 10! This results in a 15! He's successfully made a Healing Potion!",
								"Unfortunately he's stayed up too late, but the next morning the party lets him sleep in to avoid the level of exhaustion.",
								"Two days later, Vandrin the Cleric, the groups only healer, is on death's door! A quick swig of the healing potion gets him back on his feet, and the day is won thanks to the hard work of making a potion, and adventurers keep a keen eye out for more of those curative reagents! Woah"
