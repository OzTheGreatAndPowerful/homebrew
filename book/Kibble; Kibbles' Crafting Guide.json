						"Crafting has long been a major focus of the game, and something countless players have sought to engage with since the early days; after all, what adventurer wouldn't want to be better outfitted, better equipped and more prepared... and what adventurer wouldn't want the chance to put their personal mark on their gear?",
						"The core principle of this crafting system is simplicity and specificity. Everything works with simple, easy to follow rules, but has enough depth to lift the burden from a GM having to fill in every blank by giving specific details for everything. While a GM is always the arbiter of what exists and if a crafting recipe works, by and large this system can be run with as much or as little input as a GM wants to add. It's a complete package that provides all the necessarily details for your players to get started\u2014and plenty of tables and guides for GMs as well.",
						{

							"name": "Why do you need Crafting?",
							"entries": [
								"Some people may wonder: why do you need a crafting system? Isn't that what loot is for? The truth is, in some games, that's true. Not every adventurer is going to want to pursue crafting. But with a crafting system, not only can you craft what you need without finding it in a dragon hoard, what you find in that dragon hoard can be so much more.",
								"In a game with a robust crafting system, there is no junk, there are just more opportunities and fresh possibilities. A +1 shortsword that no one can use could be the valuable basis of a new spear. Gems, gold, relics, and recyclables... all valid entry points for the crafter's creativity.",
								"Adventurers are inherently innovative folks on a quest for creative solutions to difficult problems. Crafting gives them that toolbox.",
								"So... why do you need crafting? You don't. But you should probably want it."

							"name": "Who can craft?",
							"entries": [
								"Anyone! Who can succeed in making something useful? Perhaps a bit of a different story. Crafting is not inherently tied to class, though in some cases some classes may give benefits to it (like Inventor); crafting may come from your background in the form of a tool proficiency, or it may be something you learn during your adventures following the old adage of necessity being the mother of invention.",
								"Crafting is mostly about the time, effort, knowledge and materials. As such, most of crafting is knowing the recipe and having the time and materials needed... but a skilled craftsman works quicker and is more successful, and in this business practice makes perfect, so there are various progression modifiers that apply. Your GM can determine if your background would merit starting your adventure with any, otherwise guidelines for how to gain them are included."
							]

						{

							"name": "What can I craft?",
							"entries": [
								"Anything! But this guide is made by a mere mortal, and is thus limited in scope. This guide will provide the principles of crafting for many fields\u2014from alchemy to engineering to woodworking.",
								"The basis of how crafting works is similar between each field, but the recipes, material, and most important results will be radically different... After all, a healing potion, a catapult, and a magic sword are all things you can craft, but the process for each varies quite a bit.",
								"The goal of this document is to teach you how to get started, and provide the basics that will get you a long way into your adventure, but not make a complete codex of everything that could potentially be crafted. When you hit something that doesn't appear in this document, just reference the closest items and make a bit of a leap to what extra steps might be needed to realize your vision into your game world!"

								"The GM still adjudicates many instances of them, but the ideal is to have a system in which the GM does not have to handcraft every instance of gathering materials and crafting.",
								{
									"type": "inset",
									"name": "Working with your GM",
									"entries": [
										"While the system is meant to enable player-driven choice, always remember to work with your GM. Check in with them when selecting an item you would like to make and confirm that item exists in their world, and any assumptions hold true.",
										"Some GMs may rule that some items have higher rarity or are simply not available at their default assigned rarity. A common example of this may be something like Winged Boots, which are only rated as Uncommon, but some GMs may feel they are a better fit for rare and adjust their difficulty accordingly."

								"On the other hand, if the GM wants to get the players into it, there are some tools they can use. By far the most effective tool is to give the players reagents as part of loot that don't have an obvious place to sell them. If you give players 2 curative reagents, they are going to start looking into how they can use those, as they'd much rather have a healing potion.",
								"If you want to go one further though, if you give them 5 curative reagents and they realize they will have a remainder of one... then they start looking into \"Well, how do we get a 6th!\""

To produce standard items with standard effects, the process for finding or buying the materials and using them to make what you want to make will be straightforward.",
								"How much of the detail you want to engage with as a GM can be easily adjusted by how you hand out reagents. By sticking to the standard ingredients and using their generic names, the materials are no more complicated than handing out gold or other rewards (and can even be fully converted easily to a gold-based system if you want the most simplified version), but if you'd like to have specific ingredient names and exotic ingredients there is information in the appendix you can draw from for that."

The crafting time of this system is very compressed compared to the systems you might find in the base options because this system is not intended to use downtime to gate crafting.",
								"Rather, this is built to work with an adventuring lifestyle. You might need a little time here and there, but it will be measured in hours rather than days and weeks. Consequently, the gates to crafted items are instead the materials and skill required rather than time and gold, though you can certainly use gold to buy those materials in some cases.",

For the purposes of crafting, this can be recorded simply as a \"common poisonous reagent\" and used as such in crafting.",
										"This greatly simplifies the process of crafting and recording what your supplies are. Narratively speaking, a skilled alchemist can render down the ingredients they want to use in the form they need.",
										"Each crafting profession will have some profession-wide materials that are used in their recipes: reagents for alchemy, metals for blacksmithing, etc.",

Additionally, it can perform skilled crafting checks. It always uses the taking 10 rule for crafting checks, completing one check every 4 hours. Its crafting modifier is +5.
