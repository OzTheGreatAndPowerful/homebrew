					"Berberoka are scaled ogres who lurk in rivers, lakes, and other bodies of water where they seek their prey. Though they can subsist on fish, berberoka far prefer the flesh of air-breathing creatures, especially humans, elves, and dwarves. They are solitary creatures, though every few years they are compelled to venture to other lairs and reproduce, giving birth to small Berberoka who seek out their own aquatic lairs. Most prefer freshwater lakes and rivers, though reports of berberoka lurking in coves, inlets, and other calm saltwater places exist.",
					"A berberoka secretes an oily substance that attracts fish to its location. If especially hungry, a berberoka can subsist on the fish hatit attracts, but it normally uses these schools of fish to lure surface-dwelling fisherfolk, whom it then seizes and attempts to drag to their doom. This substance can be extracted from a dead berberoka, making it an extremely valuable commodity."

Unfortunately for Lillith, her many betrayals mean that none of the other fallen trust her any longer. In spite of this, none can deny her great power. She keeps a heart-shaped fortress in the battle plains of Gehenna, which is guarded by six legions of horned devils, each of which is commanded by a pit fiend. She spends the majority of her time crossing into the mortal planes to tempt paladins and holy priests to damnation. She drags their souls back to her fortress for eternal punishment or presses them into service as fodder for her legions. She has a personal contingent of death knights, each of whom was once a lover that she seduced from the path of righteousness and good by her charms and machinations."
