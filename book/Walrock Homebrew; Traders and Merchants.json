						"Though few of their ilk consider it. adventurers are far from being the only individuals enterprising and foolhardy enough to journey the wider world in search of fortune and glory. Merchants travel far and wide, often finding themselves at bustling hubs of business, such as port towns, trade hubs, and the more mercantile strongholds that pepper the disparate reaches of the world. Each merchant has their own motivations for and methods of pursuing free enterprise, and for every merchant just trying to get by, there's at least one more with fervant dreams of someday. somehow, making it big and retiring to comfort and fortune.",

This expansion is designed to work with the core {@loader Fortresses, Temples, & Strongholds|book/Warlock Homebrew; Fortresses, Temples, & Strongholds.json} option available at Warlock Homebrew, though these merchants can function equally well when found throughout the wider world.",

								"Holding little interest in coin, the fey prefer to trade in favors, sealed by a {@spell geas} spell, to compell their customers to act in certain ways. As such, fey bargains have no currency cost, but have an associated price in geases, rolled randomly on the {@table Geas Table|TradersAndMerchants|Geas tables} below. If a geas would not apply for whatever reason, reroll until you receive a geas that does. These geases must be known by the customer before they are agreed upon and, though the fey may not lie, they may attempt to egregiously mislead those with which they deal. Fey merchants will only typically trade one item per person for geases, considering overburdening their customers with geases to be impractical.",

Briefly he holds it aloft, waves it slowly around, and then shakes it violently before sighing and placing it in a pouch at his side. As he opens the pouch, a careful onlooker could spot a wealth of similar strange creations and contraptions, before the human quickly and carefully ties his pouch shut.",
								"Set up adjacent to an inn, a man with tossled hair and a surprisingly vivid bow-tie has a collection of odd wares spread across a ramshackle wooden table that appears inexpertly cobbled together. Behind the man lies, on its side, an oblong and smoldering blue box, into which he reaches periodically to retrieve new goods, appraising each in turn before shrugging and placing them upon his slapshod table.",

Through either a quirk of reality or their own design, a few denizens of a future time may stumble into the past. These individuals almost always have returning to their native time as their driving goal, and may be willing to trade away some of their foreign resources to gain the currency they need to achieve this end.",
