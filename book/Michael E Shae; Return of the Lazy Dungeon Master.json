The ideas in this book are based on reviews of hundreds of videos, articles, books, and interviews, as well as the shared experiences of thousands of DMs and GMs. ${@i Return of the Lazy Dungeon Master begins with an eight-step process for game preparation, then builds on those steps to expand into a full discussion of how we prepare our games, how we run our games, and how we think about our games.",

(Thankfully, many RPG sourcebooks and Gamemaster guides can help shepherd new players through the steps of running games for the first time.) But you don’t need to be a hardened veteran to make use of this book. If you have any amount of experience running RPGs, {@i Return of the Lazy Dungeon} Master can help you learn how to {@b get more out of your RPGs by preparing less.}"

By any measure, the popularity of {@i Dungeons & Dragons} continues to rise.",
								"Lots of new people are coming into this amazing hobby. Lots of people who left the hobby are coming back again. The game has changed. We have changed.",
								"Even with all this change, though, the ideas in the original {@i Lazy Dungeon Master} hold up. People still talk about how that book remains a valuable resource for learning how to prepare less—and to run better roleplaying games at the same time. For Dungeon Masters and other Gamemasters reading the original book today, the ideas found within it work just as well in our current games as they did in our games five years ago.",
								"So why write this new book?",
								"Because we’ve all learned a lot since then.",
								"Though {@i The Lazy Dungeon Master} holds up, there are always new ideas to add. We can polish and refine the original concepts with the experience of tens of thousands of Gamemasters to make them even more useful.",

Nothing has been copied over directly. Every idea has been reexamined and rewritten in the context of what we know today.",

Rereading the table of contents every few months can then help cement the core ideas of the Lazy Dungeon Master in your mind.",

If any of those topics aren’t clear, you can dig deeper into the chapter to see what it’s talking about.",
								"The end of the book contains a list of references and further reading, including books, RPG sourcebooks, articles, and videos for further research into running great games. If you want to dive deeper into becoming a great Gamemaster, these references are the best place to start.",
								"{@b Read this book in whatever way best suits your needs.} If you prefer reading it cover to cover, that’s great. If you prefer to skim the contents and pick out the topics that interest you, you’ll likewise learn from it. If you find that these ideas resonate with you, you can reread or skim the book regularly to wire its concepts into your own mental GM’s toolkit. Like all the ideas in {@i Return of the Lazy Dungeon Master}, the book itself is meant to be used in whatever way gives you the greatest benefit. "

								},
								"Those five words represent the core philosophy of the Lazy Dungeon Master. Our goal is to learn what parts of our RPG preparation and execution bring the most fun to our games. Our goal is to understand what benefits our games, and to separate that from what offers little value for the energy we spend in preparation.",
								"The way of the Lazy Dungeon Master, first stated five years ago in {@i The Lazy Dungeon Master}, begins with a simple initial idea:",
								{
									"type": "inset",
									"entries": [
										"We can spend less time preparing for our RPGs and still run great games."
									]
								},
								"In that earlier book, I hypothesized that all of us as GMs spend a lot of time preparing things for our games that offer little actual value to the players. So by boiling our preparation down to only the things that matter the most, we can save considerable time.",
								"While exploring this idea, however, I found another potentially deeper hypothesis:",
								{
									"type": "inset",
									"entries": [
										"The less we prepare, the better our games will be."
									]
								},
								"Now, this seems like something that can’t possibly work. How is it even feasible that the less we put into our games before we run them, the more fun we’ll have with our players at the table? But indeed, many Gamemasters—including many GMs we might think of as experts and professionals within the hobby—have found this to be true. The less we prepare, the better our games will be.",
								"Clearly, though, this idea works only up to a point. We can’t take this notion to its mathematical conclusion of “Prepare nothing, and your game will be infinitely more fun.” Some GMs do state that they prepare nothing at all for their games, but those GMs are a small minority. The 2016 Dungeons & Dragons Dungeon Master survey, conducted at slyflourish.com, received responses from 6,600 fifth edition Dungeon Masters—only 2 percent of whom said that they spent no time at all preparing for their games. This means that roughly 98 percent of us seem to agree that some game preparation is required to run a great game.",
								"Certainly, there is a point at which too little preparation can harm the fun of a game. Though we can often prepare less than we think we need to before a game, we must prepare something. And because all GMs are different, what we need to prepare to run an RPG session varies. Yet many of us instinctively cluster around a few key preparation steps that can help us prepare less and still run great games.",
								"Instinctively, each of us develops our own individual list of preparation activities by looking at every step we typically take and every technique we use while actually running a game. Then we ask ourselves, “Is this really useful? Is this really fun? And does it bring enough joy to the game to be worth the effort?” Each step and each component is worth drawing out under the cold, harsh light of reality, so that we can examine it dispassionately.",
								"Let’s look again at our Lazy Dungeon Master mantra:",
								{
									"type": "inset",
									"entries": [
										"{@b Prepare what benefits your game.}"
									]
								},
								"It’s easy to see that this simple statement has a negative space. In thinking about what best benefits our games, we can also think about what does not benefit our games—and we can ask whether those things might best be discarded. If we extend our mantra into describing this negative space, we have the following:",
								{
									"type": "inset",
									"entries": [
										"{@b Prepare what benefits your game, and omit what does not.}"
									]
								},
								"This second part of the process can be hard. As GMs, we’re all so rooted to the ways we’ve always done things that it’s often difficult to let those ways go. We don’t have to make a big plunge into abandoning what we’ve always done, though. Instead, we can run small experiments.",
								"We can {@b try things out.}",
								"We don’t have to throw away five thousand dollars worth of miniatures to try running combat in the “theater of the mind” once or twice. We don’t have to get rid of five hundred pounds of 3D terrain to try out the flexibility of a single blank poster map for a couple of sessions. We don’t have to toss out a three-ring binder holding hundreds of pages of world building to try out some spiral campaign development.",
								"Trying out a new idea or removing a preparation step we typically take doesn’t mean we have to do so forever. We just might give it a try for a game or two and see how it feels.",
								"For some Gamemasters, time is such a limited commodity that the question of what to throw away isn’t the problem. Some GMs just don’t have the time for a lot of game preparation—even to the point where a lack of time prevents some would-be GMs from running games at all. Hopefully this book can help—because preparing for a game requires less time than you might think.",
								"{@b Using the game preparation checklist in this book takes about fifteen to thirty minutes for a four-hour game.}",
								"So whether you’re just looking for ways to refine your own game preparation or seeking a system that saves you time, this book hopefully has a few ideas that might resonate. Let’s dig in."

However, as GMs, all of us must always be ready to throw our potential scenes away when the game goes in a different direction—as it often does. Usually, it’s enough to come up with only a few words per scene, and to expect one or two scenes per hour of play. At other times, you might skip this step completely if you don’t think you need it."

Secrets and clues are single short sentences that describe a clue, a piece of the story, or a piece of the world that the characters can discover during the game. You don’t know exactly how the characters will discover these clues. As such, you’ll want to {@b keep these secrets and clues abstract from their place of discovery} so that you can drop them into the game wherever it makes sense. This lets the game flow freely, while still allowing you to reveal important pieces of the story at any point where the characters might discover them.

										"Describe each location with a short evocative title such as “The Sunspire.” Then write down three fantastic aspects for it, along the lines of: “Blazing beam of light shining to the heavens,” “Moat of molten rock,” or “Huge elven glyphs carved into ancient stone.” Ultimately, whole dungeons can be built from a series of connected fantastic locations, with each location representing a large area or chamber.

They want to nail the negotiations with the king’s viceroy. They want to discover the single clue leading to the lost temple of the White Lotus assassins in the deepest jungles. They want to cleave through a small army of bugbears single-handedly. Players want their characters to do stuff, and GMs need to remember this as we prepare our games.",

The foes you choose might be monsters that the characters are particularly good at fighting—perhaps an army of zombies that the cleric is eager to turn.",
