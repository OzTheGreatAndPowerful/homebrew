						"Reading and playing other roleplaying games makes us better Game Masters and players because it improves our design skills. In some way, all players, including GMs, are game designers. If you have created a world, adventure, encounter, magic item, monster, feat, spell, puzzle, or trap, you're a game designer. If you've ever made up a rule because you didn't like how the official one worked, it didn't exist, or you just didn't feel like taking the time to look it up, you did a little game design, my friend. If you've proposed a new use of one of your character's skills, spells, or traits to your GM or created your own background by taking the skills from one, the tool proficiencies of a second, and the feature of a third, you are 100 percent designer. Heck, if you created your character's personality traits, ideal, bond, and flaw from scratch, then let me be the first to welcome you to the game design club. You'll love it here. We have snacks.",
						"One person strengthening those design chops provides a richer experience for everyone at the table. Just like trying new recipes makes you a better cook, experiencing other games increases your skill and understanding of game design and makes you a better player.",
						"When you interact with a lot of different games, you learn to design toward different goals and styles of play. For instance, the world's oldest roleplaying game is built around battling monsters, which is why a majority of a character's class features and most of a creature's stat block are dedicated to combat. If you pick up a game like {@link Bubblegumshoe|https://www.evilhat.com/home/bubblegumshoe/}, which is about teen detectives in the modern world investigating crimes, you can see the rules are centered around solving mysteries in a way that a game about battling monsters isn't. After reading just a few pages of {@link Dusk City Outlaws|https://scratchpadpublishing.com/dco-info}, you'll realize that the game is all about planning and pulling off heists, and that it gives you great tools to do so.",
						"You can and likely will have investigations and heists in the world's oldest roleplaying game, the same way you can have combat in Bubblegumshoe and Dusk City Outlaws, but each system executes all of these elements with various levels of depth and satisfaction. When you read and play other games, you can introduce the concepts and mechanics from one into the other, and you gain a deeper understanding of how games work. The more games you experience, the easier it becomes to absorb new rules and parse the motivations behind them.",
						"If time, money, and finding players is a concern, you should know that most RPGs out there don't require three core rulebooks (some are {@link one page|https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/337120/Mundane-Magic-RPG}), many RPGs have {@link free or reduced-cost versions|https://www.faterpg.com/2013/the-new-era-of-fate-is-here/} or {@link reduced-price starter sets|https://cityofmist.co/collections/sets/products/the-starter-box}, and {@link a lot of people are willing to try a game as a one-shot if a friend offers to teach them|https://app.roll20.net/forum/category/22}. You can also do what I do and seek out new games at conventions (online and in-person), which always feature a GM eager to teach folks their favorite system.",
						"Players and designers often turn to other RPGs when we want to do something in a game that the rules don't currently allow. Matt and I both wanted to see rules for level-0 characters in ARCADIA because we both enjoy low-powered play. When {@link Chris Bissette|https://twitter.com/pangalactic} pitched an article for level-0 rules inspired by the funnels of {@link Dungeon Crawl Classics|https://goodman-games.com/dungeon-crawl-classics-rpg/}, {@link MÖRK BORG|https://morkborg.com/}, {@link Troika!|https://www.troikarpg.com/}, and {@link Mothership|https://www.mothershiprpg.com/}, I knew that we were creating something special, because those games are fantastic and Chris is one of the best designers out there. Combine that article with {@link Sally Tamarkin's|https://twitter.com/sallyt} new backgrounds and collaborative settingbuilding guide and {@link Mario Ortegón's|https://twitter.com/elwarius} flavorful and innovative subclasses, and we've got one of the best issues of this magazine yet.",

Conversely, a higher power could disavow a character for breaking a cardinal tenet, or failing to fulfill their end of a bargain. Either of these developments sets the character on a journey of redemption\u2014or, with a sufficiently disgruntled god or patron, marks the beginning of a powerful antagonist entering the story.",

They can be used as transitional points in a character's arc, changing their previous subclass to one below and using it as a stepping stone on the journey to regain their original powers, or as the foundation of a new path.",
						"Alternatively, characters who are content with the idea of being at odds with their gods or patrons can remain as members of these subclasses to represent that stance.

She followed in their traditions by climbing the ranks of the faith of the Sentinel, a deity of vigilance and protection, and became a revered shield-priest as soon as she came of age. After decades of duty, the prestigious Order of the Everguard recruited Misiri and charged her with the protection of Empress Nebrala II.",
								"Years later, after two encroaching nations moved in to occupy their lands, Misiri saw war decimate her kingdom. Empress Nebrala refused to negotiate with the invaders and sought a way to defeat the invading forces. She found an ancient dwarven spell scroll that could open a rift to the Plane of Earth to raise a mountain from the ground.",
								"During the siege of their last remaining stronghold, the empress ordered Misiri to cast the spell, but the shield-priest refused to endanger the people of the citadel. Furious at her insubordination, the empress had Misiri arrested and took the scroll to cast the spell herself. As the guards seized her, Misiri witnessed in terror as rising crags tore through the citadel, ending hundreds of lives in a matter of seconds. In an act of desperation, she broke free from the hold of the guards, took her sword, and ended her empress's life, halting the spell. Though her actions saved thousands, Misiri was branded a traitor to the kingdom and earned the contempt of her god.",
								"Now Misiri wanders as an outcast, carrying her fractured shield at her back but never wielding it. As the subject of the Sentinel's scorn, she has learned to turn the doom of her god's ire against others, carving a new path for herself as an anathematic cleric in order to survive."

His first brush with death came shortly after his initiation, when he was betrayed on a heist to steal an {@item iron flask} from a local treasure hunter. After a literal stab in the back from his supposed allies, quick-thinking Rucio gave the traitors his canteen and kept the magic {@item iron flask} as they left him for dead. On the brink of death, he opened the flask and released a powerful pit fiend, who offered him a chance to live by making a warlock pact.",
								"Bolstered by infernal power, Rucio hunted the turncoats down and moved on to become a renowned adventurer. But the more fame and fortune he found, the more his patron demanded. Rucio spent years covertly searching for a way to get ahead of his patron and regain his freedom.",
								"Finally, after nearly a decade, Rucio found a book containing his patron's true name. Invoking it, he summoned the pit fiend and demanded two things: that the devil forget him, and that it return to the {@item iron flask}. The pit fiend complied, but only after almost killing Rucio again and snatching the book away from him.",
								"Rucio's gambit was successful: he kept his patron's power and freed himself from the devil's demands. In doing so, however, he became the target of an incessant hunt from cultists, warlocks, and devils seeking to retrieve the {@item iron flask} with the pit fiend and powerful book of names trapped inside."

After decades of duty, the prestigious Order of the Everguard recruited Misiri and charged her with the protection of Empress Nebrala II.",

Empress Nebrala refused to negotiate with the invaders and sought a way to defeat the invading forces.

Furious at her insubordination, the empress had Misiri arrested and took the scroll to cast the spell herself. As the guards seized her, Misiri witnessed in terror as rising crags tore through the citadel, ending hundreds of lives in a matter of seconds. In an act of desperation, she broke free from the hold of the guards, took her sword, and ended her empress's life, halting the spell. Though her actions saved thousands, Misiri was branded a traitor to the kingdom and earned the contempt of her god.",

Invoking it, he summoned the pit fiend and demanded two things: that the devil forget him, and that it return to the {@item iron flask}. The pit fiend complied, but only after almost killing Rucio again and snatching the book away from him.",
