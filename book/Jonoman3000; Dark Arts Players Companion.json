						"THIS CHAPTER OFFERS NEW SPELLS FOR many of the classes in the Player’s Handbook. These spells provide various ways to harness the traditionally “evil” magics: necromancy, blood magic, and shadow magic. Your DM determines whether these spells are available at character creation, or whether they are discovered in an ancient tomb or library or other storehouse of magical knowledge. Also, this chapter includes rules for a new tag: hemomancy."
