								"The lords will say you need all sorts of things to set up a successful business. That's cockatrice eggs. They're just trying to keep you from becoming competition. You need just one thing to start your own tavern: gumption! It also doesn't hurt to have something you're known for, like an underground portal to riches and fame. A gimmick, I guess. So, that's gumption and a gimmick, which sometimes helps with naming the endeavor. Mine's pretty apparent, right? When I emerged from that hole in the ground with my earnings, there was nothing but cattlepie as far as the eye could see. I hired some folk and got to building. Hmm, I suppose that's three things; gumption, a gimmick, and gold. We'll call them the three G's."

								"Your tavern makes money by selling food and beverages, but you must also spend money on running costs such as ingredients, wages, building maintenance, and guild fees. If more money comes in than goes out, you make a profit. If you spend more than you make, you end up with a loss.",

Located in the Castle Ward of the city of Waterdeep, the establishment is named after the large well in its common room \u2013 the tip of a sunken stone tower \u2013 which descends into the mazelike dungeon of Undermountain. Treasure seekers from across the Realms meet in the inn's taproom to plan their own delves, making it the perfect place to start an adventure!",
										"The Yawning Portal was built in 1306 DR by the notorious adventurer Durnan, who founded the inn using treasure looted from his own expedition into Undermountain. Durnan later returned into the mad wizard's maze, leaving the business to his family, but returned almost a century later to reclaim his property. Today, the apparently ageless adventurer dares his patrons to enter the dungeon below and claim their own destiny!",

										"{@b Brewery.} Brewing your own ale is a must if you want to escape the outlandish rates that private brewers charge. If your brew is good, you can even supply it to other taverns in your area!",
										"{@b Cellar.} A stone-lined cellar allows you to stockpile wines and spirits at temperature and hold reserves of ale inside giant storage barrels.",
										"{@b Coach House.} A coach house is the last word in lodging services, transforming your establishment into a full-blown coaching inn. This puts you on the map for wealthy customers traveling between settlements.",
										"{@b Dancefloor.} A dancefloor fitted to your saloon bar or taproom lets your patrons revel late into the night and work up a profitable thirst! Its success depends on the quality of your minstrels, so it carries a considerable startup cost.",
										"{@b Distillery.} A distillery allows you to distil your own brands of gin, rum, or whiskey, for sale on and off the premises. Fiery branded liquors are vital for raising your tavern's profile and boosting revenue.",
										"{@b Feasting Hall.} If your fare is fine, investing in a dedicated seating area with table service is sure to open your establishment to the wealthier upper classes.",

										"{@b Larder.} A storage area for wholefood supplies with a cool room for perishables. Any establishment looking to improve its fare should start with one of these.",
										"{@b Lavatories.} Most taverns make do with an outhouse, ditch, or screened-off chamber pot for patrons to relieve themselves in. Building a lavatory indoors is the height of luxury and sure to make your tavern a talking point around town.",
										"{@b Office.} An office provides a secure space to manage your business, containing a strongbox, writing desk, and a bookcase for ledgers and paperwork.",
										"{@b Saloon Bar.} A separate bar for guests who are prepared to pay a little extra, with comfortable seating and table service. Saloon bars typically offer some form of entertainment to boot.",
										"{@b Snug.} The snug, or \"smoking room\", is a private room for paying patrons. It's not solely the preserve of the rich: servants often pop into the snug for a cheeky drink while running errands in town.",
										"{@b Stable.} Most taverns provide posts for hitching horses, but a dedicated stable provides extra security for patrons staying overnight. It's also an additional revenue stream: aside from basic stabling charges, patrons can pay extra for their horses to be fed and brushed down.",
										"{@b Stage.} A stage is a raised platform for minstrels, storytellers and actors, typically nestled to one end of your saloon bar or taproom.",
