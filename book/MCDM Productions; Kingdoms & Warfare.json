The idea that the world is divided into spheres of influence and power, with specific people in charge of those things. Even as a teenager, I played in lots of different fantasy worlds, and I judged them all based on one thing: the map. I used maps as the keys that unlocked the different domains in a world.",
                        "Maps are one of the GM’s most powerful tools. The map of the local area, the map of the region, the map of the city, the map of the world. Because maps invite exploration. A map explicitly asks the players to pore over it, point to something evocative or mysterious, and ask: “What’s this?”",
                        "In the ’80s and early ’90s, there was an explosion of new, official campaign settings. New fantasy worlds for RPGs. And my friends and I were excited to try them. But whenever I saw the mapIn the ’80s and early ’90s, there was an explosion of new, official campaign settings. New fantasy worlds for RPGs. And my friends and I were excited to try them. But whenever I saw the map of a new world, I always wondered the same thing: “Who’s in charge here?” I don’t know why that was important to me. Probably, I was just looking for some kind of organizing principle. Some kind of lens to view all this new information through.",
                        "I didn’t literally think, “Whose domain is this?” I wouldn’t have used that language. And I never thought exclusively about barons and dukes and queens. If I pointed to a great forest, I wouldn’t expect it to belong to a feudal noble. I know how fantasy works: it’s a big forest, so it probably belongs to the elves!",
                        "But which elves? Surely a forest this big is an important asset, and some elven court considers it their realm. Their domain. And if not, that’s probably because it’s contested! A hot or cold war over ancient elven boundaries! Drama!",
                        "Or maybe the forest belongs to an order of powerful druids. Maybe they keep it deliberately wild and pool their resources to ensure no single civilization takes it over! Well, those druids would be just another domain.",
                        "That’s how my mind worked then, and how it still works. It’s okay if some places aren’t controlled by anyone. But then, as now, when I see a map of a fantasy world and there are no political boundaries, no answers, no information to tell me, “Who’s in charge?” anywhere, I get disappointed. I feel like...there’s a layer of information missing.",
                        "To date, there’s never been an edition of the world’s most popular roleplaying game whose core rules took the idea of different domains—whether those are counts and dukes and queens, or druid enclaves, wizard circles, or knightly orders—and gave them mechanical features. Not just, “Oh, you get this one feature if you join this organization,” but rules for letting different organizations engage in planning, conspiracy, and conflict the way people do.",
                        "That’s what this book tries to do. I wanted to give you the tools to add organizations and warfare to your games and make doing so fun. When players think about their own party of heroes, even without changing anything about their characters, I hope they’ll recognize at least one of the organizations or specializations in here as fitting their group.2 When GMs see all the different NPC realms in the book, I hope they’ll want to run new adventures with a hag coven as the villain, building a secret army in the swamp. Or an evil empire run by an immortal dragon. A draconic tyranny!",
                        "When players choose an organization and a specialization, their characters gain new mechanical features—but they’ll also feel more like a formal group. They’ll have to communicate more to use their new domain powers, and will argue about how best to use domain features during a new phase of the game, called intrigue. Everyone will communicate, argue, and compromise—just like the members of a real organization.",
                        "This book will give the heroes and villains in your games more influence, more impact. Their reach will extend beyond the end of their swords or the range of their spells. The party’s agents can go out and spy, research, build, and negotiate, all while the heroes are dungeon delving. And of course, when those heroes discover that another domain is building an army to march against the people who look to them for leadership, they can build their own army and prepare for war!",

                        "A {@b domain} is a pretty simple thing as a game concept. It’s got four skills. It uses actions and reactions and bonus actions, just like characters and monsters. It has three defenses, but no hit points. The only way to “kill” a domain is to neutralize its officers—although some might escape and start a new domain for the sequel campaign! A domain could be a kingdom, thieves’ guild, or druid circle!",
                        "An intrigue only ever takes place between two domains. That makes the system simple and easy to keep track of. Other domains might get involved, but purely as allies, lending aid. Of course, depending on the adventure, it’s possible that a particular intrigue is just a prelude to another larger intrigue as the characters discover the villainous realm they just defeated was only a pawn in an even larger game....",
                        "Alongside the intrigue system, the book presents eight different heroic organizations (each of which can be customized with three specializations) and sixteen different NPC realms to use as allies, neutral observers, or enemies.",
                        "{@b Warfare} is conflict between units of soldiers and monsters. Along with rules for warfare, you’ll find seventy-eight special units in this book and another sixty-four in the special unit deck available on our store (at {@i mcdmproductions.com/warfare-deck}).",
                        "So while it might look like an enormous amount of stuff in here at first glance, it’s really just two systems, each relatively straightforward, and then a ton of options for those systems.",
                        "The book also contains a handful of new items that can affect intrigue or warfare. And because they were popular in {@book Strongholds & Followers|SaF}, you get some new legendary artifacts called the codices. (Warning! They will unravel the fabric of reality!)",
                        "Strongholds & Followers presented six courts of extraplanar creatures that the gods might send to aid characters in battle if their faith is strong enough. Those were so popular that we expanded them with three additional courts—devils, demons, and undead. New monsters! Some of these creatures use the action-oriented design philosophy mentioned in “Running the Game #83,” designed to make it easier for a GM to use a single monster to challenge an entire party.",

And you can always refer back to the glossary if you’re looking for a quick definition.",

You can start using these rules right now, with your existing characters in the middle of your current campaign—or even right in the middle of an adventure. In fact, we hope these rules take your group and your adventures and elevate them, granting everything a broader scope and a feeling of raising the stakes. In a world where the forces of powerful domains vie for control of ancient artifacts and forgotten lore, every adventuring party and their enemies can now be listed among those domains.",
                                "The easiest way to adopt these rules is to imagine that the heroes in your game are already an organization, with the players picking the specific type of organization from the eight in this book. Then set up the villains of the adventure as a villainous realm, which the GM picks from among the sixteen in the book.",
                                "You can stop there if you like. Domains have options that give their officers—both characters and NPCs—more things to do during an adventure or between adventures. But an organization is more than just its officers. There are followers, agents, and employees all ready to carry out the characters’ and NPCs’ orders. As such, leading a domain means players can have their organization conduct research or espionage while the characters continue exploring dungeons or fighting dragons.",
                                "Domains grant their officers access to domain features that become usable during intrigue. The GM will use the rules for intrigue to make the campaign more memorable as it moves toward one or more warfare battles that mark the intrigue’s conclusion, with the heroes plotting and scheming against a villain as their organization uses its domain features and domain skills to prepare for battle—even as the villain does the same!",
                                "Domains also grant their officers access to domain powers. These are new special features that allow characters to work together during any combat that takes place during intrigue against the officers of an opposed domain—just as the villain and their lieutenants will be working together on that opposing side. This includes the combat that runs alongside the potential climactic final battle at the end of intrigue. (Though not all adventures need to have a final battle, it’s great fun!)",
                                "The warfare rules in this book are robust enough to be used as their own game. This can be a fun way to play out small skirmishes or major battles, and it works fine without using the rules for intrigue.",
                                "But finally—and most ambitiously—all these rules work together as a whole. The heroes become an organization as they plot and scheme against the villain’s realm, making allies and raising an army. Time and again, they confront enemy leaders in combat using their new domain powers while their loyal forces clash around them! And though they might not be something that ends up a part of every session, battles between the armies of domains can lend an epic feel to any adventure. It’s a little more work, certainly, but that work pays off in the kind of conflict that pushes players and GMs toward the biggest possible adventure finale.",

Domains can come into conflict all on their own as villains try to blow up the world or some small part of it, and the heroes trying to stop them likely don’t need to know, “Exactly how many square miles do they control?”",
                                "In addition to helping keep these rules flexible and easy to adopt, worrying about the literal area of a territory likely isn’t something most people will find exciting in a game about pretending to be an elf who fights dragons. So in the end, the rules simply assume it takes about a week (however this is defined in your world) for a domain to carry out a single domain action. And even that can be easily tweaked to any length of time, as it’s deliberately abstract. For a particular game, it might work to have a domain turn be a week at the beginning of an intrigue, but then only a single day at the end as the pace quickens and the stakes rise."

And they managed to get in, get it, and get out without anyone noticing. Those resources could have been put to better use if that drug doesn’t end up on a bolt in Castagan.”",

Our agents got into the Tower of the Lens, got the drug, got out with no alarms. No searching, no deaths, no guards alerted. No trace.”",

But if we give them a body? And we say, yeah this piece of piss tried to sell us this juice, but we didn’t even know what it was! We asked him where he got it, he got defensive. Says he stole it from you wizards, right? And we said, ‘Oh, you trying to offload your scrab on us so you can go back to the Lens and frame us? Pull the other one.’ Then he got pissy and tried something, and we sorta had to kill him or whatever!”",

                                "“With all the intel Aurex ferreted out?” Thel said. “Their wizard’s true name? The guards you blackmailed?”",

                                "“Yeah, that is a pisser,” Zarek said. “We gonna fight our way in, boss?”",
                                "“Well, it’s been a month. I was hoping a solution to that would have presented itself.” Thel frowned. “It’s not too late to seek special assistance. We could call up the Crew.”",
                                "“Don’t you get it?” The goblin smiled, chuckling. “Narco here got halfway there, but it’s up to the charming goblin to seal the deal.”",
                                "“Get it over with,” Aurex said. She held out her blade to see the dim light of the tavern glint off the shining gray metal before being absorbed.",

We take the {@i dreamtime} back to the Tower of the Lens, we give ’em some corpse they can pin all their suspicion on, just like Narco and Zarek say. Then we say ‘Goodness, would you like this back? Seems expensive.’ But then we say, ‘We don’t want paying.’ Maybe Aurex’s people dig up some dirt on the Lens? Should they even have this stuff? It’s illegal as shit. So, you know, we embarrass ’em, lie to ’em, give ’em someone else to be suspicious of, a little blackmail thrown in for good measure. Then we just offer to give it back to ’em. Free.”",

                                "Garrote made a “psh” noise. “Wizards are easy. You just gotta flatter ’em before you threaten ’em.” He smiled. “By the time I’m done with ’em, they’ll think it was their idea.”",

                                "“Blackmail, intel, drugs.” Garrote nodded at the three vials of {@i dreamtime}. “Just a day’s work for us, boss.”",

Most monsters are defined by their combat prowess, and many of a character’s best class features revolve around making them a better monster fighter.

This is the same way things would pan out if you weren’t using the new rules in this book. But with these rules, every officer in a domain has new special features called domain powers. These powers require communication and cooperation to use, even as armies clash in warfare to all sides.",

Even for a campaign that’s in the middle of an adventure right now, players and GMs can adopt the new rules in this book to provide a framework for the campaign’s existing plots and intrigue—then raise the stakes for both heroes and enemies in a warfare battle!",

For example, if an organization has +2 marked off in Diplomacy and the players mark off the next two boxes to reach +3, the organization’s Diplomacy modifier increases to +3.
