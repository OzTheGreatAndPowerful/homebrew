For example, your GM might let you bounce your shield around a corner to attack a target with total cover as if it had half or no cover, or throw your shield at a metal staircase to create a loud diversion. GMs are encouraged to lean toward the \"rule of cool\" and reward creativity when adjudicating such situations."

								"If you look at the table of contents for this issue, you'll notice something weird\u2014I wrote one of this month's articles. James commissioned me to write it back in the distant mists of time (also known as 2021), well before I approached the managing editor chair. But now that I'm here, I thought it'd be a fun opportunity to give a backstage tour of the inspiration, the design process, and how our MCDM playtesters make everything better.",
								"We've published several subclasses for spellcasters in ARCADIA, but none for barbarians, fighters, rangers, or rogues\u2014and James and my D&D groups were super into the idea of a shield-wielding fighter. Captain America is what most folks think of, but my own inspiration actually came from {@link Hades|https://www.supergiantgames.com/games/hades/}, where I've spent many hours wielding Aegis, the Shield of Chaos, as I fight my way out of the Underworld. I also wanted something that would suit the shield-maiden archetype, which mixes history and myth into a top-notch fantasy aesthetic.",
								"Armed with these concepts, I started scribbling down ideas for cool things to do with shields, as well as ideas for magic shields and new equipment. These early notes were like having a conversation with myself\u2014there were a lot of question marks for things I wasn't sure about or hadn't solved yet. Early on, I thought the Shieldbearer might have a list of maneuvers, like the Battle Master, or that I'd design light, medium, and heavy shields, with different techniques available for each, but neither of those worked in practice. Designing character options is a lot like assembling a puzzle, except you're drawing the image and cutting out the pieces at the same time!",
								"When I wanted to procrastinate on writing, I researched the history of shields, so I could represent more variety than the medieval European {@link heater shield|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heater_shield} and more specificity than the generic shield in the core rules. I also looked for cool real-world battle maneuvers involving shields, like a more realistic version of {@link this scene|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDte-axR9l8} where a bunch of guys with huge shields become a human cannonball. I didn't find any such battle maneuvers, but I did gather some inspiration for a few of the magic shields!",
								"Ultimately, the Shieldbearer subclass completely ignores two unfortunate real-world facts: shields don't actually make good weapons, and throwing a heavy, not particularly aerodynamic object is unlikely to be effective no matter how strong you are. A tricky game design challenge is balancing consistency in a game world where the laws of physics are (by default) similar to our own with the need to set realism aside for the sake of epic fantasy. In the original draft, a Shieldbearer could only throw their shield a number of feet equal to 5 × their Strength modifier, but James and the testers talked me out of that limitation. Now the Shield Toss {@footnote 1|talked {@i myself} out of naming this feature \"Shield Yeet,\" but by all means, live your meme dreams at the table.} feature gives you a normal range of 30 feet and a long range of 60 feet. More fun, less arithmetic.",
								"Speaking of the testers, extensive and effective playtesting is at the heart of what we do here at MCDM. Everything we release goes through at least two full rounds of playtesting, where our amazing testers give the material an in-depth read, run games with it, and enter specific notes in a well-organized spreadsheet. As a managing editor, this is a dream, and as an author, I love getting feedback from the testers to catch issues, confirm or refute concerns, and help me deliver on my vision. For example, the first version of the Shieldbearer gave two features at level 3 that {@i seemed} substantial, but neither one was very impactful\u2014something I wouldn't have realized without testing. Designing a good subclass is tricky, as no one typically has time to play it from level 1 to 20, but the testers' input helped deliver the right features in the right order so it's balanced and fun to play at any level. Having two rounds of playtesting is invaluable\u2014it keeps us from over-correcting and gives us the chance to actually test out more than one approach.",
								"I'm delighted that the Shieldbearer shares an issue with two fantastic articles overflowing with creatures and adventure threads for your game. {@link Sam Mannell's|https://twitter.com/crypticparlour} \"Appendix NPC: Part 2\" brings even more ridiculously useful stat blocks, including a protective auto-sentinel robot friend, a dragon priest who's a lot cooler than ye olde generic cultist, and a demigodly saint who'd make an excellent final boss. And \"The Scribes\" may sound like an order of dusty librarians who never leave the stacks, but these meddling Writers are here to make legendary, epic, important events {@i happen}, thanks to authors {@link Hook & Chance|https://hookandchance.com/} and {@link The GM Tim|https://thegmtim.ca/}.",
								"Thanks for joining me for this design retrospective! I hope you enjoy this issue as much as I do\u2014and please tell me all about your epic Shieldbearer adventures."
