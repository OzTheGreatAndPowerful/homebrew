						"In 1985 I was fifteen and a sophomore at Cypress High School, and I spent the year in my computer science class with Brad Thomas and Chris Steele talking about Elric and the Black Company and the Incarnations of Immortality. They were friends outside of school, part of a larger group, but I was still hanging out with the kids I grew up with in my apartment complex. I knew Chris and Brad played board games and roleplaying games, and I wanted in.",
						"At the end of the school year I signed their yearbooks: ‚ÄúIf you guys get together to play games, give me a call.‚Äù They did. About thirty seconds later, they were my best friends. It changed my life.",
						"We spent that summer playing board games and RPGs and going to the mall, and the arcade, and hanging out at the pool. It‚Äôs a time and place that has now been immortalized and paid homage to in popular fiction. When I want to connect with my mother‚Äôs formative years, I watch {i American Graffiti}, filmed one town over from where she grew up. Folks looking for that same experience for my generation‚Äôs formative years watch {i Stranger Things}. It was easy for an adult back then watching us sitting around Dave Miles‚Äô pool table rolling strange dice, listening to Rush, and pretending to be elves to imagine we were wasting our time. And not just adults, a lot of our peers felt the same way. But I never did. I knew something worthwhile and remarkable would come out of the hobby: a lifetime of creativity and memories and shared experiences doing something amazing with my friends whom I loved. You don‚Äôt need YouTube or Kickstarter, it‚Äôs reward enough just ending up at the end of your life being able to look back on the worlds you created and shared with your friends and the heroic adventures you undertook. The hobby isn‚Äôt a means to an end, it is an end unto itself. And while the places and events and people and things we create and meet in our secondary worlds are not real, one thing is.",
						"Dreams are not real. Nothing that happens in a dream is real. With one exception. Chris Nolan wrote a whole movie about it.",
						"{i Inception} takes place in dreams but it‚Äôs about movies. It argues that while all these people and places and events are not real, something in film is. The emotions you feel watching a movie are real. That‚Äôs what gives them meaning and value. When I watch Casablanca I fall in love with Ilsa every time. Generations of kids watched {i The Adventures of Robin Hood} and ran outside play-swordfighting. Because the emotions you feel at the movies are real. Inception is using dreams to make a point about movies. And, I argue, RPGs.",

						"Once upon a time in the dim days of the hobby known as the 1970s, the game assumed you played until you were about 7th level and then built a stronghold. There were no rules for this, nor was any reason given for why the player or their character might want to do such a thing.",
						"For those original players, building a stronghold was a {i self-evident good}. It was just neat, and they assumed it would be obvious why you would want to do such a thing. It meant your character was now interested in things besides killing orcs and acquiring gold. Treasure was a means to an end. As your character grew in power, they became more concerned with the state of the world. There were political conflicts and armies and incursions from other dimensions, and a single fighter with a sword, even a very nice sword with its own personality and special purpose, was not enough. You needed an army, or new spells, or extraplanar allies.",
						"The game transitioned from local problems to national problems, to global problems. Eventually, your 7th-level character fought a few wars or invented a spell or two, and then retired. Typically around 13th level. And that was it. The game had an end.",
						"This book seeks to recreate that style of play, but in a modern sense, by giving the players reasons to build strongholds. And we got a lotta reasons. üòÉ",
						"In this book you will find rules for four types of strongholds: {b keeps} help you raise armies and improve your fighting ability, {@b temples} help you summon extraplanar allies to aid you in battle, {@B towers} let you research new spells, and {@b establishments} let you collect secrets and generate cash.",
						"Every stronghold also improves your signature class feature, powering up your Bardic Inspiration or your monk‚Äôs Ki. Strongholds grant {@b improved class features} because they draw power from the land itself.",
						"The local area around your stronghold is called your {@b demesne} (deh-MAIN). Within your demesne, your character is now, if not ruler, certainly a very important person, so the power of the land manifests itself in unusual ways in your favor.",
						"Building a stronghold also inspires people, allowing you to {@b attract followers} by rolling on a chart specific to your class. These followers could be mercenary legions or artisan peasants, foreign ambassadors or fellow adventuring heroes!",
						"Large-scale actions taken by your new army, your stronghold, or your followers sometimes take {@b months or seasons}. Also, your new abilities eventually run out of juice, after which you must return to your demesne to refresh yourself. This is called an {@b extended rest}.",
						"To support these new options, the book comes with many new systems, including rules for {@b warfare}, in which {@b units} of soldiers clash; rules for {@b concordance}, which allows any character to plead with their deity for aid; rules for {@b creating new magic items}; and rules for taking your {@b retainers} with you into combat without having to run an entire second character.",

								"The deva, planetars, and solars are beings beyond the ken of most mortal worshippers. For mortals worthy of aid, for those who pledge their life to defending the helpless and opposing evil, the gods of good and righteousness send lesser servants, the Celestial Court.",
								"The home realm of the Celestial court is unknown in this day, if the ancient empires knew of it, that knowledge has not yet been rediscovered. Modern sages believe each member of the Court exists as a thought in the minds of the gods of goodness and righteousness and when summoned, they are created. In some sense it is known that the Court of Paradise or Court of Heaven as they are sometimes called serve all the worthy gods. These creatures may have no home plane, unlike the other servitors.",
								"These beings are utterly alien. They are the manifest will of the gods, and their nature is unknowable. They can communicate, but their words are a string of open poetry and verseless rhymes. Scholarly consensus is that these words are untranslatable gibberish, but opinions differ. One problem in translation is that each person who hears any member of the choir invisible speak, hears different words. This led sages for centuries to assume that there was nothing to translate, seeing the mortal mind as incapable of holding the thoughts of the Court in its head.",
								"Others, undaunted, argue that this just means more collation is needed, and that if enough listeners wrote down what they heard, and these transcriptions were compared, meaning‚Äîperhaps oracular meaning, warnings of catastrophes to come‚Äîwould be revealed.",
								"All the Celestial Court are angelic beings, and their weapons are considered magical and do bonus radiant damage. They all project an aura of protection against evil.",
								"As far as theologists and philosophers can tell, there‚Äôs only one of each of these beings. So if you summon a princip, for example, and it casts haste twice before the battle is over, summoning another princip later that day would summon the same one, and it‚Äôs only got one haste (or remove curse or stoneskin) left. They cannot be killed by any power less than that which kills gods. Death on our plane is just a failure of their manifold projection into the timescape.",

									"entries": [
										"Herald of the Righteous Power, the Princip arrives ready to crown an ally, bestowing on them a greater destiny, granting them immunity to spells that charm or dominate and raising one ability to god-like levels.",
										"The character so crowned feels a rush of divine power, a tiny fraction of the same energy all the Celestial Court are made of. Apart from the blazing crown over their head, their new power manifests as beams of light shooting from their eyes, their skin flashing to gold in an instant, or their hair turning to blazing, heatless fire. Upon losing the crown, they feel a period of melancholy as their previous greatness flees, leaving them mortal, again, and lesser.",
										"{@b Tactics}: The player who summoned the Princip decides who it crowns, which doesn‚Äôt have to be the summoner. If the player can‚Äôt decide, or hesitates, the Princip has its own ideas‚Ä¶",
										"The Crown prevents any attempt to force its wearer to behave in any way contrary to their will, so the Princip tends to Crown the character most likely to fail a Wisdom saving throw. The wearer of the Crown chooses which ability they want to raise, but raising Wisdom while wearing the Crown isn‚Äôt the best use, as you‚Äôre already basically immune to charm person and other mind-dominating spells. That is, unless you use Wisdom for spellcasting, in which case 24 Wisdom is going to rock your enemies for however long it lasts.",
										"Raising Constitution to 24 means you‚Äôre probably not going to lose the Crown when you take damage. And you‚Äôll gain a bunch of hit points, making you less likely to die. But 24 is so high (+7!) that you can even raise your best ability and be even better at whatever you do. So it‚Äôs a choice between surviving longer and doing your thing better.",
										"Once someone is Crowned, the Princip enjoys wading into battle and smashing things with its scepter. Like all the Court, the Princip prefers to smash evil over neutral monsters, but it tends to try to defend the character it Crowned, even over the character who summoned it. However, if it thinks the Crowned character is now so powerful it doesn‚Äôt need help, it defaults to the character who summoned it (if they‚Äôre different people). If neither its summoner or the Crowned needs help, the Princip defends the most vulnerable party member.",
										"While one character is enjoying the benefits of temporary godhood, the Princip dispenses other buffs to the party in an attempt to turn the tide of battle. Which, wow, it‚Äôs gonna do that. It can cast haste three times, which is enough to make a huge difference on its own. Or stoneskin for anyone who‚Äôs getting hammered in combat, and remove curse in case the party was in trouble when it arrived.",
										"If the battle lasts long enough, or if the Princip is summoned again after using its daily spells, it hands out shield of faith and enhance ability to the PCs, giving each of them a little pep talk in its own bizarre fashion. The Princip enjoys proclaiming the heroes‚Äô greatness a lot, speaking in flowery prose that doesn‚Äôt make literal sense but conveys the idea that it thinks the heroes are literally glorious.",
‚ÄúBehold! The power arises! Leaves fall, men die, yet all shall be consumed by the endless river of glory!‚Äù
										"Um, what? The endless what now? Well, it tried. It probably means, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre gonna do great!‚Äù Don‚Äôt think too hard about it, it‚Äôll just give you a headache.",

										"The Authority arrives on our plane in heavy armor, armed with the Brightsword and looking for evil to smash. It is responsible for maintaining celestial order, and while it‚Äôs still absolutely committed to smashing evil, it tends to smash chaotic evil a little more than other evils.",
										"The Authority sometimes appears spontaneously in times when a good king or democratic civilization is facing an existential threat. It seems concerned with the fate of the human race. Whether this represents some kind of political stance on the part of the Celestial Court as a whole, or a priority peculiar to the Authority is a matter of great debate.",
										"Badrashanti Dar, a sage from the Shauraseni Empire speaks of ‚Äòan angelic host clad all in golden mail with six wings and a burning helm‚Äô who strode across the battlefield of the last Shauraseni emperor, thousands of years ago. This is the earliest known record of the creature that is recognizably the Authority. Dar records the being as pronouncing judgement on the battlefield, saying ‚ÄúOurs is to defend the children of the earth!‚Äù But this translation is debated and there are none left who speak the sage‚Äôs language natively.",
										"If Dar‚Äôs record describes the Authority, then there is reason to believe the Authority has been a part of every major, decisive battle between good and evil in the last 5,000 years. Sometimes affecting victory, sometimes being overwhelmed. But in each instance allying itself against tyranny and cruelty. The gods, it seems, have hope for the human race and send their greatest servants to bolster that hope among mortals.",
										"{@b Tactics}. Well, it finds the biggest, most evil thing and bashes the hell out of it (perhaps literally) with the Brightsword. This thing does 3d6 + 4d8 + 4 damage to evil creatures, which is like 32 damage on average, and it can do this three times per turn. And it has wings and a fly speed of 40 feet, so it can get where it needs to, to do what it must.",
