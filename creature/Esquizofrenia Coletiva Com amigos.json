					"In the ethereal realm where death and the beyond converge, a death god harnesses the power of a rare and formidable entity known as the Death Seer. As a precursor to the deity's ominous arrival, the Death Seer awakens from its eternal slumber, a herald that announces the impending transition from life to the unknown.",
					"Appearance:",
					"The Death Seer is a sight to behold, veiled in an otherworldly presence. Blind to the physical realm, its spectral form is adorned with green ghostly eyes that orbit around it like haunting satellites. A luminous green heart beats rhythmically within its incorporeal chest, an enduring symbol of its connection to the forces of death.",
					"Abilities:",
					"Dream Manipulation: The Death Seer possesses the ability to delve into the dreams and nightmares of the living. With a mere thought, it can weave illusions or unveil subconscious fears, sowing the seeds of anticipation for the impending arrival of the death god.",
					"Telepathic Communication: Silent as the void, the Death Seer communicates through telepathy, projecting its message directly into the minds of its chosen targets. The chilling whispers carry promises of relief from the burdens of existence, instilling a false hope that the end of mortal suffering is nigh.",
					"Immortality: As an undead entity, the Death Seer is immune to the ravages of time and decay. It exists in a perpetual state of slumber, only roused from its eternal rest when summoned by its creator, the death god.",
					"Role in the Lore:",
					"The Death Seer serves as both messenger and harbinger, orchestrating the psychological prelude to the death god's impending arrival. As the death god stirs from its celestial abode, it awakens the Death Seer, unleashing it upon the world to prepare the hearts and minds of the living for the inevitable embrace of mortality.",
					"In the wake of the Death Seer's influence, the boundaries between reality and the unknown blur, and a pervasive sense of anticipation permeates the land. The stage is set for the arrival of the death god, as hope and despair dance in an eerie waltz, guided by the spectral hands of the Death Seer."
