The target's vision is distorted and their balance is off. They make attacks with disadvantage. 2. The target can't tell friend from foe and must spend their turn making a melee attack or casting a cantrip against a random creature within range. If no target is within range, they must move up to their speed towards the nearest creature and make an attack against it. 3. The target's reaction time is slowed. All attacks made against them have advantage and their speed is reduced by 10 feet. 4. In their mind's eye the target see their greatest fear manifested. It drives them mad and they must use their action to Dash in a random direction. Creatures affected by the hallucinogen can repeat the saving throw at the start of each of their turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

						"Frenzy This disease affects the nervous systems of many creatures, altering their behavior over time to become more aggressive and unpredictable. Rock gnolls carry a particularly virulent strain. Infected creatures begin showing symptoms after 1d4 days, including headaches and increased thirst. The infected creature suffers one level of exhaustion, has disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks, and requires twice the usual amount of water each day. At the end of each long rest, the infected creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw against the disease. A successful save decreases its level of exhaustion by one. If this reduces the level of exhaustion to zero, the creature is cured. A failed save increases its level of exhaustion by one and the disease intensifies. After one failed save, the creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw whenever it is placed in a stressful situation or spend its turn making a melee attack against the nearest creature, moving up to its speed if necessary. The DC for this saving throw increases by 2 for each level of exhaustion above 1. If the infected creature has 4 levels of exhaustion (hit points halved), its mind is consumed by the disease and it reverts to an animalistic and wild state, attacking any who come near it. Until the disease can be cured, the creature's Intelligence is reduced by 10 (minimum 3)."

After one failed save, the creature has a strong desire to surround itself with as many creatures as possible. After two failed saves, the creature becomes more irritable and violent.
