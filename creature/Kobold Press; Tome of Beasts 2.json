Once created, an august rooster can reproduce with any species of bird, which usually results in an exotic-looking example of the bird.

The constant turmoil of its internal struggle leaves the chimeric phantom a chaotic mess of faces, voices, and body language that shift as its emotions change and as minor personalities take hold for seconds at a time. Its struggle is never-ending, permanently damaging the psyches of all the souls that make up the chimeric phantom.
