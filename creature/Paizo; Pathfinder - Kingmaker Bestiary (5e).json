Taking inspiration from the {@i Pathfinder: Kingmaker} video game created by Owlcat Games, suggestions and observations from over 10 years of feedback, and our own desires to build upon the framework presented the first time around, we have expanded the scope of the {@i Kingmaker Adventure Path} dramatically. Most significantly, we've redesigned the adventure to offer more than enough sandbox play for the PCs to be able to advance all the way to 20th level by the campaign's end\u2014indeed, some parties who focus on completing every possible encounter might find themselves hitting 20th level well before the campaign reaches its final chapter!"
