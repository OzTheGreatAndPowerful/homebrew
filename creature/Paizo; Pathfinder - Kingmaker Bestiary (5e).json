Taking inspiration from the {@i Pathfinder: Kingmaker} video game created by Owlcat Games, suggestions and observations from over 10 years of feedback, and our own desires to build upon the framework presented the first time around, we have expanded the scope of the {@i Kingmaker Adventure Path} dramatically. Most significantly, we've redesigned the adventure to offer more than enough sandbox play for the PCs to be able to advance all the way to 20th level by the campaign's end\u2014indeed, some parties who focus on completing every possible encounter might find themselves hitting 20th level well before the campaign reaches its final chapter!",

Though the rules for building kingdoms and running warfare encounters presented in the {@i Kingmaker Adventure Path} use Pathfinder Second Edition as their foundation, every effort has been made to make those rules as self-contained as possible. Since playing out Kingdom turns and warfare encounters occurs largely outside the scope of the adventure's primary plot, you can use these self-contained rules as add-ons to any 5E game\u2014or any game that uses another rules system. Of course, as mentioned above, developing familiarity with Pathfinder Second Edition rules and mechanics can help you to run kingdom-building content and warfare encounters. If you prefer to avoid that, keep in mind that the {@i Kingmaker Adventure Path} still works if the kingdom develops in the background through narrative play.

												"The cultists of the Kingdom of the Cleansed seek to build a new society from the bones of the old. They excel at recruiting newcomers to their faith with promises of transcendence. That they worship the demon lord Yhidothrus is a secret known only to the higher ranking members and their half-fiend leader, a mysterious figure known to them only as the First Faithful. These cultists have all survived a dangerous ritual that grants them the power to release the “inmost worm,” a mental projection of their faith. Those who fail this ritual become {@creature bodak|PKB|bodaks} instead.",
