Since playing out Kingdom turns and warfare encounters occurs largely outside the scope of the adventure's primary plot, you can use these self-contained rules as add-ons to any 5E game\u2014or any game that uses another rules system. Of course, as mentioned above, developing familiarity with Pathfinder Second Edition rules and mechanics can help you to run kingdom-building content and warfare encounters. If you prefer to avoid that, keep in mind that the {@i Kingmaker Adventure Path} still works if the kingdom develops in the background through narrative play. See the various chapters in the Adventure Path for advice on how to run kingdom development in this manner."

As your players defeat foes and search for loot, don't hesitate to adjust the amount or type of treasure handed out in encounters to help keep your PCs appropriately geared-up for the fights to come. It's a good idea to generate replacement treasures ahead of time so that when your players defeat the monsters, they won't have to wait for you to pick and choose their prizes!"

										"Peludas are territorial, feral dragons that favor building lairs in reedy marshlands, sparsely forested bogs, and river valleys. A single peluda typically claims a stretch of waterway a few miles in length, often choosing a den somewhere near a river’s source. After doing so, the peluda systematically drives off any potential rivals so that they can despoil the land as they please, leaving clawed footprints on muddy riverbanks, littering the ground with sharp scales, toppling trees, and impaling half-eaten corpses on their quills as trophies left to rot. Though protective of their homes, peludas often venture beyond their domains to hunt, roasting prey with their breath or pulverizing them with their tails, burning and killing for cruel sport before slithering, sated, back to their murky lairs.",
