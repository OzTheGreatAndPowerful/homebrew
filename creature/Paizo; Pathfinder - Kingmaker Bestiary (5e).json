Most significantly, we've redesigned the adventure to offer more than enough sandbox play for the PCs to be able to advance all the way to 20th level by the campaign's end\u2014indeed, some parties who focus on completing every possible encounter might find themselves hitting 20th level well before the campaign reaches its final chapter!",

Since playing out Kingdom turns and warfare encounters occurs largely outside the scope of the adventure's primary plot, you can use these self-contained rules as add-ons to any 5E game\u2014or any game that uses another rules system. Of course, as mentioned above, developing familiarity with Pathfinder Second Edition rules and mechanics can help you to run kingdom-building content and warfare encounters. If you prefer to avoid that, keep in mind that the {@i Kingmaker Adventure Path} still works if the kingdom develops in the background through narrative play.
