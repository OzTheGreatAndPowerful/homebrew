The character suffers no ill effect, but the bloodrager who caused damage enters a blood frenzy, gaining advantage on attacks against the bleeding target until either the target or the bloodrager is slain. Due to its recklessness however attacks against a frenzied bloodrager have advantage. A bloodrager can only gain advantage against a single target, who it will try to slay at any cost, even ignoring other foes altogether."

Use the game statistics of a giant hyena with the added vampire resistances and weaknesses and the extra 9 ({@damage 2d8}) necrotic damage on a bite and the accompanying hit point reducing and regenerating effects. Once transformed the bloodrager assumes the creature’s total hit points and reverts to its humanoid form if its hit points drop to 0, any excess damage carrying over to the bloodrager’s regular hit points. The transformation can also be dismissed as a bonus action. Bloodragers often turn into wolf form when they enter a blood frenzy."
