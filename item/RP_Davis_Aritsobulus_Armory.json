				"{@bold Subtype}: Armor (Light); ",
				"{@bold Description} (Player Facing): Consisting of a finely-tailored suit of doublet and breeches made of supple leather, the armor can pass for mere clothing.",
				"{@bold Features} (GM): While attuned to and wearing the Leathers, when you finish a long rest in a city of more than 10,000 inhabitants the Leathers become +1 armor, and you gain the ability to cast vicious mockery once per day. If you leave the city, the magic becomes inert until you finish another long rest in a city as described."
