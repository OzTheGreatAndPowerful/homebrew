				"{@bold Description} (Player Facing): Paulo laughed and laughed and laughed, wading through the attacks. Arrows splintering to pieces off of his magnificent breastplate. He cackled as the soldiers charged him, spears at the ready and almost shat himself in glee as he saw the great loping bugbear roar in frustration at how deftly the matching magnificent shield deflected his resounding blows.",
				"Paulo had waded into their camp an hour ago and was beside himself with joy imagining the accolades he would get from the King… and the presents… the gifts… oh, the women! His was a smug satisfaction at the invulnerable splendor encasing his body… right up until his squire, an old cutpurse Paulo had pressed into service from the capitol took a moment and squinted at him. The look on the old, toothless man’s face went from curiosity to disbelief to annoyance to determination as he walked up close and put a knife through Paulo’s heavy steel gorget, mail, leather, and throat. As he bled out on the ground, the old thief spit… “lying twat”.",
				"{@bold Features} (GM): The armor itself is nothing so much as a lightweight scarf wrapped around one’s midsection. It offers no protection from the elements or natural hazards and is extremely fragile. However, any and all attack rolls against the wearer are made at against an AC representative of the illusion the wearer desires (and he can reset once per day). The more unbelievable and rare the armor imagined, the lower the DC Wis save to disbelieve it is real. Once per scene, a creature may have a Wis save to disbelieve the armor upon first seeing it. On a success, there is no armor, only a pale pink and green scarf (ugly at that) wrapped around the wearer’s midsection. On a failure, the armor is “real” to that person for the scene. Simple common light armor is a DC23, medium armor DC18, heavy armor DC13. Every resistance added to the armor (represented by appropriate visual effects on the illusory armor like a bluish glow for cold or skulls for necrotic) decreases the DC by 5. So, “wearing” slashing resistance heavy plate (plate with “great rounded and smoothly polished guards to deflect blades”) is a Wis save DC 8 for all creatures the first time they see it and every scene thereafter. “Taking off” the armor or putting other armor on gives all the observers a new save immediately with advantage.",

				"{@bold Description} (Player Facing): The camp was quiet, but the old paladin was not.",
				"“You can come out. I know it’s time… I’ve been waiting.”",
				"The moon was new and the forest dark, had there been a fire it would have been helpless against the flowing night spilling out from the treelines. Broadways was cinching his last gauntlet, breathing even and slow while sounds—inhuman and uneven—spat and hissed and shuffled around him.",
				"There were… twenty. Maybe more. His old campaigner’s ears knew their business, and the things in the dark were waiting. If they were autonomous, they’d either chatter or rush all together; if they were only minions of some central evil he’d be chiming in right about now…",
				"“Huuuuuman… yooooooo naaaawt weeeelcomb… naaaawt heer…” a voice from over his left drawled out–the Night’s Tongue.  He’d heard it often enough that he could place it easily.  And as he picked up his small oval shield and tapped the rim on his chestplate, the flash of light bought him two things:",
				"A split second advantage to rush the bastard and a moment of joy as he heard the horde scream in pain.",
				"{@bold Features} (GM): The Paerma is small oval shield, barely large enough for a halfling to hide behind were it not for his feet.  Close inspection shows that its leathery surface is (morbidly) made from perfectly cut herring-bone patches of skin—each as small as a coin.  The skins patches were trophies kept by The Haxian, a zealous cleric three-hundred years ago responsible for cleansing the Ophea of the monsterous undead.  Each patch was cut from the forehead of an undead creature slain by his wrath.",
				"In the center of the shield is the cleric’s crown (the bone dome of his skull) polished to a high gloss shine, an ivory-white irregular circle nearly six inches across.",
				"Attunement to the shield requires the killing of a necromancer, his last moments of life leaving his body while on the shield.  For this reason combined with the oddly unearthly materials of the shield, most of the faith’s champions—even the most righteous and intense—find themselves unequal to bearing it.",
				"Once attuned however, the shield provides two boons to the bearer.   First, on any surprise round, if the wielder gets to take a turn, they may use their reaction to smack the rim of the shield against any hard surface to cause a flash of pure, radiant, divine light to arc out around them. This light has the effect of causing any undead creature to lose their turn in the surprise round.",
				"Second, the wielder may take an action to use the shield to bash (as an improvised weapon doing +0 magical 1d4 + Strength bludgeoning; any features, feats, or other rules allowing for shield bash with proficiency bonus may apply if applicable).  This bash forces the Diseased condition on any undead creatures, even if they are Immune."

				"{@bold Description} (Player Facing): Teller started the careful process of wrapping the long strap of boaxhide around her midsection. Around, then over, then around, then over–the motions were familiar to her, as common as brushing her hair out of her eyes. The rest of her comrades were tired, they’d spent the night in fitful watches, waiting for hell to climb the hill.",
				"The lower encampment was, if anything, larger than the last one—and that had nearly killed them all. Soldiers, pink-faced and ready, were lined up to storm the earthy mound and give them all a death long in the coming. But, without worry and almost without care, Teller continued the ritual, taking her time and doing it right, wrapping herself in the protection of her clan and family and preparing herself for the blood to come.",
				"If the emperor wanted this hill, she’d make his very best bleed for it.",
				"{@bold Features} (GM): When the cultists of the Child God came to the windswept tundra of the Southlands, they were escaping persecution in the Old Empire and seeking a place to call forth the horror that is the center of their worship. The Child had never touched this world directly, though its servants had murdered nations in the past to bring that about. Had it not been for the sacrifice of every last living member of the Intuer Clan in fighting back the first few steps of the infant demigod into the world, there would be no living thing left today. But, Lanaria of the Wild—the Clan’s matriarch—fought it back through the tear in reality and fashioned a ceremonial trophy cray from the hide of the arm that had clawed its way through.",
				"The Cray of the Dead God is a length of grey and irregularly blackened hide as wide as a man’s two fingers at the narrowest points and up to a foot wide at the broadest. It’s roughly fifteen feet long, ragged-edged and coarse. Attunement requires a careful, ritualistic wrapping of the leather around one’s body in a ceremonial observance of one’s own possible and welcomed (if the spirits demand it) death; Religion check DC20 to get it right, DC 10 for Barbarians. Failure on this check means one cannot properly work the garment/armor for a number of weeks equal to one’s level."
				"One attuned, the armor grants the wearer an inconsistent, but powerful defense against damage. Give the player 9 cards from a conventional deck (2 through 10, each number once), then from the remaining deck, the DM draws one card and places it face down on the table. The PC has an armor class of 10 + their Dex modifier (as though unarmored), and with a Reaction (can be done in response to being hit), the Player may play any card from their hand to increase the AC of the character by that amount. That AC is the standing AC for the character until they are successful hit (even if no damage is done), then it returns to 10 + Dex modifier. When the player uses a card, it is discarded and they cannot use it again.",
				"At any point, the player may ask that the DM’s card be used (this is done blind, they do not know the value). It also goes away on a successful hit. Only when all the player’s cards have been used can they be re-dealt 2-10 again (and the DM redraws a single card, as at the start; discarding whatever they had, if they still have one).",
				"Once unattuned, the armor cannot be reattuned by the same person. The chaotic nature of the Great Old One is an untamed and wild thing."

				"{@bold Description} (Player Facing): He looked up. Hrast and his horde of flapping monstrosities soared high over him, headed right for the now tired and enraged darkgnawer. It bled a rancid ichor down its side and panted through yellow and rotted teeth, staring hate right at Ser Broadways, catching its breath and looming so enormous over the trees. With him, Meila was flying, encased in purple light, the tail of her comet streaking proudly behind her. Those two were as different as water and oil, but they charged in together.",
				"To his left, Teller and Wyatt were sprinting for the monster. Her eyes were serious and dark, her greatsword held high. She cut the picture of the fury of the wild, the strength of her people, and the rage barely contained beneath. Wyatt’s lankey frame bounded with her, three arrows nocked in his bow, the casual and smart grin he usually sported replaced by grim dedication.",
				"To his right, Oakley was a great and ferocious bear, bounding over rocks and fallen trees, teeth bared and a purposeful intelligence behind those eyes. His head was low, his gaze never moving from the thing. Chrimstin raced along with him, daggers drawn—so he hadn’t run afterall… even in certain death. Some people, Broadways mused, just surprised you.",
				"And as the paladin, stood there, with everyone charging toward the demon, he called its name. And as the thing roared back, crouched to unleash that unholy power again, the old warrior smiled. There was no better way to go out, than beside old friends.",
				"{@bold Features} (GM): Clad head-to-toe in gleaming armor, Captain General Halnifar of the Children of the Morning killed the Greater Lord Demon of the Skhiux whose name cannot be known and cast his body into the darkness between worlds. The great echoing chasm of nothing that keeps the heavens apart. He was raised, bodily, to serve at the hand of the Valiant as a guard in the great Temple of Light. His heavenly raiment replacing his earthly ones and taking his true place as a Deva of the high order.",
				"What became of his fabled armor is lost to time, but the chestpiece, a dull steel breastplate without mark or blemish, was worn by conqueror’s from the hobgoblin kingdoms to the dwarvish cities to the settlements of the Empire and more.",
				"The breastplate itself is a worthy piece of armor, a +1 breastplate for any wearer, attuned or not. Attunment, however, requires killing a demon and removing its vile presence from the face of the world. And once, attuned, the breastplate grants the wearer some of the power the Captain General had in life.",
				"At the start of the wearer’s turn and only the start, they may grant their action, bonus action, or reaction to an ally within earshot. This can allow the ally to have two bonus actions for their turn, as an example. The wearer loses that action, bonus action, or reaction for themselves. To grant it, the wearer must define what they want them to do with it (attack and name the target, cast and name the spell, use a feature ability, take a manuever, overwatch for runners, etc.) and the granted action, bonus, or reaction is bound by that if the ally wishes to use it.",
				"The ally does not have to use it, but if they do not it is lost. They cannot change what they are ordered to do, only given a chance to do their normal action AND the order. Orders can be heard, normally, by allies with a Passive Perception of 10 within 25ft; by allies with a Passive Perception of 15 within 75ft.; and by allies with Passive Perception of 20 within 225 feet given normal surroundings. Rushing wind, storms, water, walls, other noise and calamity may disadvange this.",
				"Should the wearer retreat from a battle (even using one’s movement to move away from a threat, barring moving towards another one), this power cannot be used for 1 week."

The old boatswain meant it. They’d kill him as easy as sinning and leave him lost at sea—just another cautionary tale for the boys at the docks that dreamed of plunder.",
				"Still, he held onto the rigging of the shilemain, the tension in the air was almost thick enough to taste. Twenty hands of all shapes and sizes, a few officers, a dead captain, and a locked captain’s chest that held the promise of easy money nobody would be looking for out here.",
				"“You’re a piece of right shit, Sorka, you know that?” was all Courser could think of and rather than sound fierce, it came across as simply buying time. The old sailor laughed, deep and true, and casually motioned for one of the deckmates to walk over and bring Courser off that rail with prejudice.",
				"Those two quick, thoughtless handwaves were enough to make the young man grin, even as the grizzled thumper unfurled his club.",
				"{@bold Features} (GM): Svim Cord Armor—made of intricate and tightly braided, twisted, laced, and wrapped pieces of hard brasscord rope—is little known on the mainland, having fallen out of fashion and popularity even in the far continent with the development of cheaper and less laborious-to-make leather armors in the Northern fashion.",
				"Still, it was the favored protection of the Far Walkers—a sect of outlanders that roamed the wilds hunting for cults and conspiracies in service to the Black Spider in the days before the Bending of the Heavens.",
				"The Hornwail coat of Cord counts as +0 light armor allowing 13 + Dex modifier for AC, weighing 20 lbs. While worn, the armor subtley affects those around it. Those wishing to harm the wearer (in any way) find they cannot approach close while the wearer is fighting another. As long as there is an attacking creature adjacent to the wearer, all other aggressors avoid getting within melee range. This does not prevent them using ranged attacks or attacking others or even shouting taunts or distractions, but intelligent creatures are driven to attack one at a time in close combat.",

				"{@bold Description} (Player Facing): For a man his size, Broadways was fast. Always was, it was an advantage he’d carefully cultivated for years and times like this reminded him of how lucky he was to have been born with fast feet. As he crossed the distance between the great stone doors and the raised dais on the far side of the chapel, he managed to cover a third of the stretch before the congregants had even noticed the clamor.",
				"His friends stayed back, and wisely. They knew the drill. Raveller Thorpe had to be stopped and this dark ritual with him. The sallow faces in the crowd went from surprised, to annoyed, to furious in moments and the armored old paladin hurled himself up the processional. One hundred yards, maybe… keep going.",
				"He felt the sting of some hex or curse tossed at him and still raced on. He knocked two thin-armed cultists out of the way—hearing a satisfying “crack” as he shattered one of their jaws with his shield. Seventy yards. And another sting. Fifty. Another. The pain was intense, but still he ran on.",
				"And as Ravell looked in bewilderment at the large metal figure barrelling towards him, he croaked two words more glorious than any Broadways had heard in weeks…",
				"“Aww… shit”.",
				"{@bold Features} (GM): The Convictus was found, not created. Lassiter was the old soldier of the Lost country—fabled hero that walked the hills and plains and forests of that cursed place bringing retribution and peace wherever he went. His death at the hands of the great winged death that was the Black Tyrant is a story told by old bards to somber men of righteous mein. A cautionary tale that the greatest of heroes die, that not all stories are bright.",
				"A century after Lassiter died, it was said that a token of respect and honor carefully placed where he had fallen so long before. The Convictus is clearly and evidently not of this world at all. The half-plate armor is stunning, but unearthly. No seam, no mark, it looks like it was formed without ever having been touched by a smith or hammer. The pieces are not bolted or riveted together, they simply move and slide past each other without connection—never falling apart.",
				"Attunement requires forswearing the tides of fortune entirely. An oath to the cosmos that one walks an orderly path. Once attuned, the wearer may not spend Inspriation for any reason. The only thing they can ever do with it is give it to another (represented by their giving an encouraging gesture of some kind). They may still earn Inspiration, and grant it to others in this way, but cannot spend it themselves.",
				"Once attuned, the armor counts as +0 magical half-plate. The wearer is now advantaged on saves against magical effects—all such saves. The spirit of the old soldier steels them, body and soul, through the unearthly armor. All such spells, however, cause the wearer to take 1d4 psychic damage (regardless of the save) as the strain of resisting can be difficult. This damage die can explode (on a 4, roll again, add the total; continue until no other 4’s are rolled)."

				"The Prophet of Lindelwood, the Mad Walker of the Green. Wendel, what his parent’s named him. If anyone of them had deserved to see this out, it was him.",
				"That’s what they thought, anyway. The lot of them gathered around his body, the knight lying dead in the rain by the clearing. They stood around as the skies soaked them and shook their heads grimly. Paulo wept.",
				"As the druid’s body started changing, rotting away before them more quickly than possible–the sight of his teeth baring from drying and moldering lips horrified them, his body caved in and maggots and insects crawled out of orifices. His eyes shriveled in their sockets beneath the lids and even his bones appeared to fall apart into dirt and dust. Within moments, Wendel had decomposed into nothing and flowers began to grow.",
				"As they stood, dumbstruck and horrified and confused, they heard movement from where the knight had fallen–all spun drawing weapons and ready for their vengeance only to find a naked Wendel, Prophet of Lindelwood, pulling off one of the knight’s boots.",
				"He stopped for a moment, rain making his usually pale skin even pastier looking… “What…? They’re better than mine.”",
				"{@bold Features} (GM): The Springmail of the Farthest Reach, an artifact of the time when the Zeal Riders fought their Endless War with the Principalities of the Mad and the Feyland Court. The Wild was alive with great titanic conflict then, and then the world itself ended and few things survived the eons between then and the world as it is now.",
				"The Springmail was what the Lord of the Black Deep would wear in battle, a shirt of chain mail made of immaculate and tiny looks of seamless charcoal grey stone. All interlinked impossibly perfectly.",
				"Attuning to the Springmail requires burying it no deeper than a foot under loose soil and leaving it there, unguarded and unhidden, for a full turn of the moon. One cannot come, nor have anything else come, within a mile of it for this time. The Lords of old had a much easier time of this when the world was all wild space.",
				"Once attuned, however, it counts as +0 chain mail (though made of stone) and weighs twice as much as normal chain mail. The first time the wearer is reduced below 0 hp (requiring death saves) their body begins to decompose entirely where it lay over the course of 2d4 rounds.",
				"Roll 1d12 and then 1d10. Starting directly North (as a clockface) the d12 result is the direction and the d10 result is how many feet (take the d10 result and multiply by 5) away that a rootball starts growing over the same time as the body is decomposing.",
				"Once fully grown (and the body fully decomposed), the rootball cracks open and the character comes spilling forth from it at 1 hp, removing all conditions they had before, with 1 exhaustion, and any missing body parts or scars or blemishes gone. They are covered in gelatinous slime and look almost as though they’ve emerged from a birth. Should they reach their own remains, they may take a full turn kneeling over them, thanking and blessing the generosity of the world, and recover half their maximum HP.",
				"This only works once per day. Should the rootball resulting direction and distance be over a chasm or hole, it forms somewhere from the side of that as many feet down as uses the rest of the distance. DM’s are encouraged to be creative in this."

The Breath is a scarf of simple worn cloth, undyed and of common cotton. Attuning to it requires a careful seven-day series of blessings that must be administered by a holy of a LG temple and willingly so. A hand is wrapped in the scarf for a day of prayer, the next day the other hand is wrapped for another day of prayer, then each foot, then held to the chest, then the head, and on the last day it is worn about the neck. Once attuned, the wearer may use its special ability once, it recharges this ability once per month when they speak a short prayer to the LG gods for their blessing after a long rest. When activated (requiring one action), the DM rolls 1d4 (this is the “Duration” number) and records the number on a piece of paper or index card to the side, face down. The wearer may not take a bonus action, may move only half their base movement (if they have not yet moved), and may not take a reaction until the beginning of their next turn. In the time between now and then, the world slows (from the wearer’s point of view) until it virtually stops. The Count starts at 0. At the start of their next, if the Duration is less than the Count, the world surges back to its proper time and the wearer takes a number of points of Exhaustion equal to the Duration + 1, they may take their turn as normal. If this is not the case (the DM is the one checking), then they must decide to continue the Long Breath–the great slowing of the world–or not. If they choose to not continue it then reveal the Duration number. If the Duration number higher than the Count, the Breath ends and the world catches up and they may take their turn as normal. If the Duration is equal to the Count, the world snaps back abruptly and the wearer takes 1 exhaustion, but may continue their turn as normal otherwise. The PC may take their turn as normal, but their movement is halved and they may not take Reactions. At the end of their turn, raise the Count by 1. All other turns, counts, durations, and actions (and reactions) by all other parties are suspended (as they are frozen in time). This includes progress on poisons or spell effects. The wearer starts another turn (begin the “at the start of their next turn” sequence with the DM checking if the Duration is less than the Count…” and on)."

Earthen Step. You can cast meld into stone as a bonus action. Once you use this property, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest. Gift of Stone. You can transfer the orb's magic to a nonmagical item—a shield or a pair of boots—by tracing the stein rune there with your finger. The transfer takes8 hours of work that requires the two items to be within 5 feet of each other. At the end, the orb is destroyed, and the rune appears in silver on the chosen item, which gains a benefit based on its form: Shield. The shield is now a rare magic item that requires attunement. While you wield it, you have resistance to all damage dealt by ranged weapon attacks. Boots. The pair of boots is now an uncommon magic item that requires attunement. While you wear the boots, you have advantage on Strength saving throws, and you can use your reaction to avoid being knocked prone. "

The effect lasts until you remove the saddle, or until the next dawn. When the effect ends, the undead creature crumbles into dust.)"
