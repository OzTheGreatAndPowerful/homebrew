The Breath is a scarf of simple worn cloth, undyed and of common cotton. Attuning to it requires a careful seven-day series of blessings that must be administered by a holy of a LG temple and willingly so. A hand is wrapped in the scarf for a day of prayer, the next day the other hand is wrapped for another day of prayer, then each foot, then held to the chest, then the head, and on the last day it is worn about the neck. Once attuned, the wearer may use its special ability once, it recharges this ability once per month when they speak a short prayer to the LG gods for their blessing after a long rest. When activated (requiring one action), the DM rolls 1d4 (this is the “Duration” number) and records the number on a piece of paper or index card to the side, face down. The wearer may not take a bonus action, may move only half their base movement (if they have not yet moved), and may not take a reaction until the beginning of their next turn. In the time between now and then, the world slows (from the wearer’s point of view) until it virtually stops. The Count starts at 0. At the start of their next, if the Duration is less than the Count, the world surges back to its proper time and the wearer takes a number of points of Exhaustion equal to the Duration + 1, they may take their turn as normal. If this is not the case (the DM is the one checking), then they must decide to continue the Long Breath–the great slowing of the world–or not. If they choose to not continue it then reveal the Duration number. If the Duration number higher than the Count, the Breath ends and the world catches up and they may take their turn as normal. If the Duration is equal to the Count, the world snaps back abruptly and the wearer takes 1 exhaustion, but may continue their turn as normal otherwise. The PC may take their turn as normal, but their movement is halved and they may not take Reactions. At the end of their turn, raise the Count by 1. All other turns, counts, durations, and actions (and reactions) by all other parties are suspended (as they are frozen in time). This includes progress on poisons or spell effects. The wearer starts another turn (begin the “at the start of their next turn” sequence with the DM checking if the Duration is less than the Count…” and on)."
