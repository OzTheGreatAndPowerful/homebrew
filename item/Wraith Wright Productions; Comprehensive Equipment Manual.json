The point is to not disturb existing mechanics, but rather, add to and expand them. In the rare cases where changes do occur, those changes are highlighted and explained, making them easy to adopt or to revert to the original mechanics.",

										"This book is a portion of what used to be a larger product of the same name. As the {@i Comprehensive Equipment Manual} developed, the product became too large. What started as an expansion of the {@book equipment chapter of the Player's Handbook|PHB|5} became a multifaceted project that was approaching 500 pages. This necessitated a split into multiple books because products of such a size are unwieldly and inefficient in several ways, ways that are touched upon here.",
										"First, as the topics covered by this book expanded, it became very clear that \"equipment\" fell naturally into several categories; the {@i Comprehensive Equipment Manual} gets accessed by different users in different ways, and certain sections are wholly-irrelevant to readers who are not Dungeon Masters. In this way, a patron of the {@i Comprehensive Equipment Manual} is buying multiple products combined, and many users are ignoring large sections of the book.",
										"Second, opening and navigating a single PDF of this size can sorely tax the abilities of many computers, particularly a smartphone or tablet of the type that players might use around a table. Our continuing addition of high-density art assets further exacerbates this problem.",
										"Third, printing the book becomes a chore for those who want to use it in some physical form, particularly because each user type needs only certain portions of the document. Additionally, the print-on-demand options become impossible at such high page ranges due to the limitations of print-providing services, including for the one the Dungeon Masters Guild uses to deliver print-on-demand books.",
										"Fourth, but not of least relevance, separating the product into its natural components helps to recognize and reward the ongoing work put into this product over the last two years. A single book necessarily uses a diminishing value scale with its increasing size, relative to what the market will bear. Making it into separate books serves users with slimmer slices, providing the exact content they are looking for at a price point that is fair and is adequate to pay the artists, contractors, and other contributors.",
										"The material excised from the {@i Comprehensive Equipment Manual} now appears in three new products. {@b If you have already purchased the Comprehensive Equipment Manual on another product page of the Dungeon Master's Guild, fear not!} That product page will contain this and the other three products. You can access them at no additional cos t by going to that product page, which now serves as an anthology of these four books."

The book has rules for nonmaterial assets, properties and strongholds, business investments, hiring armies, and other uses of treasure. It also presents solid mechanisms for starting wealth on characters made beyond 1st level, and the tools to maintain consistent, balanced treasure distribution throughout a campaign.",
										"The {@b {@i Expanded Special Features Manual}} is a Dungeon Master tool that contains massively-expanded tables for magic item special features, both historic and magical (creators, histories, minor properties, and quirks). It further describes methods for implementing these features with care and imagination.",
										"The {@b {@i Animal Handler's Handbook}} has player options for using creatures as companions, mounts, and guardians. The equipment section of the {@i Animal Handler's Handbook} overlaps the contents of this book, but other portions are unique. That product also contains expanded rules for riding, training, and handling animals in battle and other scenarios.
