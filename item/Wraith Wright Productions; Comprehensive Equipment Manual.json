										"This book is a portion of what used to be a larger product of the same name. As the {@i Comprehensive Equipment Manual} developed, the product became too large. What started as an expansion of the {@book equipment chapter of the Player's Handbook|PHB|5} became a multifaceted project that was approaching 500 pages. This necessitated a split into multiple books because products of such a size are unwieldly and inefficient in several ways, ways that are touched upon here.",
										"First, as the topics covered by this book expanded, it became very clear that \"equipment\" fell naturally into several categories; the {@i Comprehensive Equipment Manual} gets accessed by different users in different ways, and certain sections are wholly-irrelevant to readers who are not Dungeon Masters. In this way, a patron of the {@i Comprehensive Equipment Manual} is buying multiple products combined, and many users are ignoring large sections of the book.",
										"Second, opening and navigating a single PDF of this size can sorely tax the abilities of many computers, particularly a smartphone or tablet of the type that players might use around a table. Our continuing addition of high-density art assets further exacerbates this problem.",
										"Third, printing the book becomes a chore for those who want to use it in some physical form, particularly because each user type needs only certain portions of the document. Additionally, the print-on-demand options become impossible at such high page ranges due to the limitations of print-providing services, including for the one the Dungeon Masters Guild uses to deliver print-on-demand books.",
										"Fourth, but not of least relevance, separating the product into its natural components helps to recognize and reward the ongoing work put into this product over the last two years. A single book necessarily uses a diminishing value scale with its increasing size, relative to what the market will bear. Making it into separate books serves users with slimmer slices, providing the exact content they are looking for at a price point that is fair and is adequate to pay the artists, contractors, and other contributors.",
										"The material excised from the {@i Comprehensive Equipment Manual} now appears in three new products. {@b If you have already purchased the Comprehensive Equipment Manual on another product page of the Dungeon Master's Guild, fear not!} That product page will contain this and the other three products. You can access them at no additional cos t by going to that product page, which now serves as an anthology of these four books.",

The book has rules for nonmaterial assets, properties and strongholds, business investments, hiring armies, and other uses of treasure. It also presents solid mechanisms for starting wealth on characters made beyond 1st level, and the tools to maintain consistent, balanced treasure distribution throughout a campaign.",

Towns of various sizes will probably have spellcasters able to manage 3rdlevel and 4th-level spells. Anything higher-level almost always requires looking for the service in a city of some size, or perhaps following a lead to an isolated wizard's tower or druid's hermitage. Sometimes a spellcaster with greater capabilities chooses to reside in a place with a low population.

If characters don't have time to seek out the best price, perhaps needing spells cast the same day, the DM will multiply the base cost in the Pay column by a number indicated in the range of the Multiplier column. Spellcasters don't like to be rushed and are often willing to inflate their costs to whatever the market will bear. This multiplier can also be applied for various other reasons. Perhaps the person seeking spellcasting services annoys the spellcaster, or the spellcaster normally reserves such services for members of a specific race or religion. There are any number of reasons that such a markup could apply; the Pay column simply represents an ideal cost derived from ideal circumstances."

This ensures that the components are on hand when needed and are of the right type and quality for the spell to succeed. If a spell requires a costly material component, the person receiving the service must bear the cost. This is additional to the basic price of the spellcasting service. When looking for spellcasting services, it's no good bringing your own material components; a spellcaster that provides commercially-available casting has already invested in the components and won't look kindly on you trying to reduce these expected fees by offering cheap alternative components from dubious sources.",
												"If a costly material component is not consumed in the casting, the customer need only pay one-tenth of the component's value. For example, the 100 gp pearl required for an {@spell identify} spell is reusable, so the caster charges only one-tenth (10 gp) of its acquisition price. After a while, the spellcaster may recoup the investment cost of having such a component on hand and might eventually turn a small profit on it.",
												"If the material component is one that is consumed in the casting, the customer must normally pay {@i double} the component's value. For example, the 500 gp value in diamonds needed for a {@spell raise dead} spell would require the buyer to lay out double the expense (1,000 gp). Casters who market their spells invest serious coin to acquire these components, tying up that wealth until the right customer comes along. The inflated price compensates them for holding onto these expensive inventories, having them ready at a moment's notice."

Many clerics see this sort of thing as their duty and don't mind supplicants who supply their own material components. Some clerics also see this as a great opportunity to proselytize, not restricting their services to members of their own faith.",
												"Another way to get free spellcasting is to perform tasks or quests for a spellcaster. This is a particularlyappropriate exchange when the spell needed is highlevel and the party is too low-level to afford it. For example, if a low-level party needs a member raised from the dead, they might need to go on a quest to repay the cleric who casts the spell.

The damage is usually {@damage 1d4}, bearing no resemblance to a real weapon attack, but the DM can increase the damage die size for a particularly large or clever use. If the weapon is magical, the DM should usually not allow its magical benefits to apply to a truly improvised use.",

Improvising piercing damage is an \"intended\" use and should include the user's proficiency bonus.

Additional food in a day is hard to process and does not reduce the count any faster.",

				"{@i A garrote is a strangulation device, typically a strong length of cord or a wire with a handle on each end. It is designed to constrain a target's intake of air and the flow of blood to its brain. Like poisons, such devices are illegal and reviled in most lawful societies.}",
				"You can initiate a {@action grapple} using this device. If successful, your target is grappled, and it is garroted, meaning it can be choked in successive rounds. However, a garrote is difficult to apply; the target of a garroting attempt can use its reaction to protect its neck, automatically negating any grapple attempts with such devices until the start of its next turn. It is therefore prudent to use this device only on targets that are {@quickref surprise|PHB|3||surprised} or otherwise prevented from using reactions.",
				"If you have successfully grappled a target with a garrote, you can try to choke the creature in successive rounds. To do so, make another grapple check as an action. If you succeed, the creature is {@condition restrained} until the grapple ends and it suffers 1 round of suffocation. A creature that suffers a number of consecutive rounds of suffocation equal to its Constitution modifier + 1 (minimum of 2 rounds), drops to 0 hit points and is dying. It can't regain hit points or be stabilized until it can breathe again.",
				"If you fail a check to choke your garroted target, or do not use your action to make the attempt on your turn, the creature's number of consecutive rounds of suffocation resets to 0. If the grapple is broken, the count resets to 0 and the target is no longer garroted. These rules reflect those for creatures that run out of breath or are \"{@quickref Suffocating|PHB|2||choking}.\"",
				"Constructs, oozes, plants, and undead are immune to the choking effects of a garrote. At the DM's discretion, certain other creatures may be immune for anatomical reasons, perhaps by having overly-large necks or no necks at all, or by possessing an irregular circulatory system."

The optional encumbrance rule makes no provision to incorporate or translate dwarves' exceptional carrying power. That important racial advantage is simply lost.",

A dwarf that is {@b encumbered} or {@b heavily encumbered} reduces the associated movement penalty by 10 feet.

Body physiology changes to adapt to starvation in ways that often cause severe complications after food is reintroduced, requiring careful refeeding for a healthy recovery.",

Instead, a starving character reduces the count by 2 days for each day of eating normally (consuming 1 pound of food). Additional food in a day is hard to process and does not reduce the count any faster.",

This \"hungry\" exhaustion level is automatically removed if the character's count of days without food is reduced to 0. It cannot otherwise be removed."
