								"A Juggernaut's main power is their shield and the bond that strengthens it. How did you come to be a Juggernaut? Who taught you your ways? Was it your mother or your father? Or did they die an dishonorable death, and you are following their footsteps to avenge them? What is the story behind your current shield? Is it special to you, or did you just find it the other day? Juggernaut is a class with the primary functiion making the majority of enemies look straight at you and want to kill you instead of those you wish to protect. Juggernauts tend to be good in nature, but depending on the environment a Juggernaut is in, they can be lawful, chaotic or neutral. Some Juggernauts, depending on where they are born or who has influenced them, can even become bodyguards or enforcers of powerful beings such as devils or kings.",
