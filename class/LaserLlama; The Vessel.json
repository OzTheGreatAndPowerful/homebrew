As the ruffians pinned him against the wall, he looked inward and called upon the sinister entity bound to his soul. When he finally regained his senses, the smell of sulfur was overwhelming. He fled the alleyway, leaving the charred remains of the brigands behind. They were but the latest victims of the dark presence he harbored within",

She did not know why she was chosen, but within her soul was bound a fallen heavenly being, charged to perform one hundred and one good deeds in order to regain its status in the celestial courts. As the crowd gathered around, she said a prayer and gave herself over to the overwhelming radiance.",

The tower's keeper, a reclusive old archmage, only kept him around as a reminder of what would happen to any who dared cross him. At night, the halfling could hear crying inside of his head, the sounds of a former student who had attempted to overthrow the great archmage, now bound to the aging body and soul of the lowliest student.",

Through their force of will, they can allow small amounts of this power out, channeling it to defend themselves, produce eldritch magic, enhance their physical abilities, and influence friend and foe.",
