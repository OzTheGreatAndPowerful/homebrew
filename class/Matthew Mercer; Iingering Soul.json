The target's spirit rises as a specterin the spaceof the corpse or in the nearest unoccupied space. The specter is under your control, allowing you to issue commandsto the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of the action, such as \"Attack that creature\", \"Run over there,\" or \"Fetch that object.\" If the creature completed the order and doesn't receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself and you to the best of its ability. You can have no more than a number of specters equal to your Aspect modifier under your controlat one time."
