						"The {@i {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}} contains a variant rule for {@variantrule spell points}, an alternative to spell slots that draws your magical power from a pool rather than using slots to cast spells. This rule is controversial for most spellcasters, as it grants a large pool of low level spells without much justification. Sorcerers, however, have the Font of Magic feature, which allows them to interchange spell slots and sorcery points. This creates a dynamic that closely emulates spell points without actually using them.",

For the remaining Metamagic, I've given new options, more frequent and consistent intervals at which the sorcerer learns metamagic, and allowed you to swap metamagic choices when you gain a new one."

This combination helps to round out the issues with sorcery points at later levels by reducing the sorcery point pool.",
								"Particularly, the overwhelming amount of low-level spells you can cast at player levels beyond 10 is replaced with powerful high-level spellcasting.
