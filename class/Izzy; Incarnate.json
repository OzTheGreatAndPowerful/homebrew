Every creature within 20 feet of it must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or become {@condition frightened} of the guardian until start of its next turn. While {@condition frightened} this way, creatures have their speed reduced to 0.",
				"{@b Titan's Guard.} Your guardian connects it's life force to that of another creature. Choose a creature within 5 feet of the guardian that it can see. Any damage that creature takes before the start of its next turn is reduced to 0. The guardian takes any damage that was reduced this way.",
				"{@b Titan's Assault.} Your guardian brutally strikes down a creature within 10 feet of it. The guardian makes an melee spell attack against it using your spell attack modifier. On a hit, the target takes {@damage 3d10} force damage and is pushed back 10 feet."
